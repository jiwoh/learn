## Enoki Mushroom and Crab Salad Rolls
    
    ### Ingredients:
    - 10 enoki mushrooms, stems trimmed
    - 10 sheets of dried seaweed
    - 1/2 cup cooked crabmeat
    - 1/2 cup shredded carrots
    - 2 tablespoons mayonnaise
    - 1 tablespoon rice vinegar
    - 1 teaspoon sesame oil
    
    ### Instructions:
