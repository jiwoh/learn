# Instructions

    ## Beech Mushroom and Goat Cheese Tart Instructions
    1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
    
    2. In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, baking powder, and salt. Cut in the butter until the mixture resembles coarse crumbs. Stir in the egg yolk and 2 tablespoons of cold water.
    
    3. Knead the mixture until it forms a soft dough. Wrap in plastic wrap and use a rolling pin to roll out the pastry to a 12-inch (30 cm) round. Grease a 9-inch (22 cm) tart pan with butter and line it with the pastry.
    
    4. Prick the pastry with a fork and bake for 15 minutes. Allow tart shell to cool.
    
    5. In a medium bowl, mix together the goat cheese, heavy cream, and eggs until smooth.
    
    6. In a large skillet, heat the olive oil over medium heat. Add the mushrooms and shallots and sauté for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the mushrooms have softened.
    
    7. Spread the mushroom mixture in the cooled tart shell. Pour the goat cheese mixture over the top.
    
    8. Bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the filling is set and golden brown. Let cool before serving.
