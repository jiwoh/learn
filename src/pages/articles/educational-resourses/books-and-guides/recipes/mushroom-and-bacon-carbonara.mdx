  # Introduction

# Mushroom and Bacon Carbonara
    
    ## Origin and History
    Mushroom and bacon carbonara is an Italian-American dish that has become popular in recent years. It is a take on the traditional Italian dish of carbonara, which is usually made with eggs, guanciale (pork cheek), cheese, and black pepper. The dish is thought to have originated in the late 1960s in Rome, when an Italian restaurant opted to use mushrooms and bacon instead of guanciale in order to make the dish more accessible to a larger audience. Since then, it has gained worldwide popularity and is now a favorite amongst home cooks and professionals alike.
