# Instructions

# Grilled Portobello Mushroom Burgers Instructions
    
    1. Preheat outdoor grill or indoor grill pan to medium-high heat and lightly oil the grill.
    
    2. Remove and discard the stems from the portobello mushrooms. Using a damp cloth, gently remove any dirt or debris.
    
    3. Heavily brush the top sides of the portobello mushroom caps with a marinade such as soy sauce, red wine, garlic and thyme.
    
    4. Place the mushroom caps, gill side down (the gills are on the underside of the portobello caps) onto the grill for about 5 minutes or until the portobello mushrooms are softened and slightly charred.
    
    5. Flip mushroom caps over, brush the outside of the mushrooms lightly with more marinade. Place cheese (such as feta, blue cheese, goat cheese or cheddar) on top of each portobello cap and close the lid of the grill.
    
    6. Cook until cheese is melted and the mushrooms are tender when pierced with a fork, about 3-4 minutes. Remove from the grill.
    
    7. Toast hamburger buns on the grill, cut side down, until lightly toasted.
    
    8. To assemble the burgers, place a grilled portobello cap gill side up on the bottom of each bun. Top with sliced red onion, tomato, lettuce, pickles and ketchup, mustard or mayonnaise as desired. Place the remaining toasted buns on top of the burgers to complete. Enjoy!
