# Instructions

## Black Trumpet Mushroom and Goat Cheese Tart Recipe
    
    ###Ingredients:
    - 4 tablespoons olive oil, divided
    - 3 shallots, chopped
    - 1/2 pound black trumpet mushrooms, coarsely chopped
    - 1/4 teaspoon chopped fresh thyme
    - 1 teaspoon chopped fresh rosemary
    - 1/2 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper
    - 1/3 cup dry white wine
    - 1 sheet frozen puff pastry, thawed
    - 4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled
    - 1 cup ricotta cheese
    - 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
    - 2 eggs
    
    ###Instructions:
    1. Preheat the oven to 375 degrees F (190 degrees C).
    2. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the shallots, mushrooms, thyme, rosemary, and pepper. Cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms are softened and golden brown, about 10 minutes.
    Add the white wine and cook until the wine is almost completely absorbed, about 5 minutes more. Set aside and let cool.
    3. Roll out the puff pastry onto a parchment-lined baking sheet. Spread the goat cheese and ricotta cheese over the top of the pastry, leaving a 1-inch border.
    4. Top the cheese with the mushroom mixture. In a small bowl, whisk together the parsley and eggs. Pour the egg mixture over the mushrooms.
    5. Drizzle the remaining 2 tablespoons of olive oil over the top of the tart.
    6. Bake for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown and the egg mixture is set.
    7. Let cool for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!
