# Instructions

### Mushroom and Thyme Baked Eggs Instructions
    
    1. Preheat oven to 350°F (175°C).
    
    2. Heat a large non-stick skillet over medium-high heat.
    
    3. Add 2 tablespoons of olive oil to the skillet.
    
    4. When the oil is hot, add 1/4 cup of diced onion and sauté for 2-3 minutes, until softened.
    
    5. Add 8 ounces of mushrooms, 1/2 teaspoon of dried thyme, 1/2 teaspoon of garlic powder, and 1/4 teaspoon of salt. Cook, stirring often, until the mushrooms are lightly browned and have released their liquid, about 5-7 minutes.
    
    6. Remove the skillet from the heat and transfer the mushroom-onion mixture to a 9x13 inch baking dish.
    
    7. Spread the mixture out in an even layer and make 6 wells in the mixture.
    
    8. Place an egg into each of the wells.
    
    9. Sprinkle the eggs with salt and freshly ground pepper.
    
    10. Bake for 12-15 minutes, until the egg whites are cooked through and the yolks are still runny.
    
    11. Serve hot with freshly cooked toast. Enjoy!
