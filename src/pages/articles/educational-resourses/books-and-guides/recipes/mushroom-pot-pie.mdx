    1. Preheat the oven to 375°F.
    2. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a skillet over medium heat.
    3. Add 1 diced onion and 1 clove of minced garlic to the skillet and cook until the vegetables are soft and translucent, about 3 minutes.
    4. Add one 8-ounce package of sliced mushrooms and cook until the mushrooms are soft and most of their liquid has cooked off, about 8 minutes.
    5. Add 1 teaspoon of dried thyme, ½ teaspoon of salt, and ¼ teaspoon of pepper and cook for 1 minute.
    6. Add ¼ cup of all-purpose flour and cook for 3 minutes, stirring constantly to prevent the flour from burning.

    8. Remove the skillet from the heat and stir in ½ cup of frozen peas.

    10. Pour the mushroom mixture into the prepared pie crust and top with the second roll of prepared crust. Crimp the edges and cut a few vent slits in the top.
    11. Bake on the center rack of the preheated oven for 30 minutes, until golden brown.
    12. Let cool before serving. Enjoy!
