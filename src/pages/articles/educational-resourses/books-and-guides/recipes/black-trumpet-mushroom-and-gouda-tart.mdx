# Instructions

## Black Trumpet Mushroom and Gouda Tart Instructions
    1. Preheat oven to 375°F/190°C.
    2. Lightly grease a 9-inch tart pan with butter or cooking oil spray.
    3. Make the tart dough: In a medium bowl, combine 2 cups/240 g. all-purpose flour, 1 teaspoon/4 g. sugar, and ½ teaspoon/3 g. salt. Cut in 6 tablespoons/85 g. cold butter until mixture is crumbly.
    Add 4 tablespoons/60 mL water and mix until dough forms.
    4. Press the dough into the tart pan, forming an even crust with no gaps.
    5. Blind bake the tart shell: Line the tart shell with foil and fill with dried beans or pie weights. Bake in preheated oven for 15 minutes.
    Remove the foil and weights and bake for an additional 5-7 minutes, or until lightly golden.
    6. Make the filling: In a medium bowl, combine ½ cup/120 mL heavy cream, 1 teaspoon/2 g. Dijon mustard, 2 cloves minced garlic, and ½ teaspoon/1 g. dried thyme. Stir in 3 cups/150 g. grated Gouda cheese and set aside.
    7. Sauté the mushrooms: Heat 2 tablespoons/30 mL butter in a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
    Add 1 pound/450 g. black trumpet mushrooms and cook until lightly browned, 5-7 minutes.
    8. Assemble and bake the tart: Spread the cheese filling evenly over the pre-baked tart shell.
    Top with the cooked mushrooms, spreading evenly.
    Bake in preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until golden and bubbly.
    9. Let cool slightly before serving. Enjoy!
