# Instructions

## Chicken of the Woods Mushroom and Goat Cheese Tart Instructions
    
    1. Preheat the oven to 375Â°F.
    
    2. Grease an 11-inch tart pan with butter and set aside.
    
    3. In a bowl, combine the flour, salt, and sugar. Add the butter and mix with a fork or your fingers until the mixture is crumbly.
    
    4. Add 4-5 tablespoons of cold water to the mixture, one tablespoon at a time, and stir until the dough holds together. Do not overmix.
    
    5. Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and chill in the refrigerator for 30 minutes.
    
    6. Remove the dough from the refrigerator and roll it out on a lightly floured surface. Transfer the dough to the prepared tart pan and press it into the pan, making sure to evenly line the bottom and sides. Trim off any excess dough.
    
    7. Prick the bottom of the dough with a fork and bake for 15 minutes.
    
    8. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large pan over medium heat.
    
    9. Add the mushrooms and cook until they are softened, about 5 minutes.
    
    10. Add the garlic, thyme, salt, and pepper, and cook for 1 minute.
    
    11. Remove the mushrooms from the heat and let cool.
    
    12. Spread the goat cheese on the bottom of the pre-baked tart shell and top with the cooked mushrooms.
    
    13. Beat together the eggs, milk, and cream and pour over the top.
    
    14. Sprinkle with Parmesan cheese and bake for 25-30 minutes, or until the tart is set.
    
    15. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
