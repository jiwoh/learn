# Instructions

## Mushroom and Sausage Risotto Instructions
    
    1. Heat 2 tablespoons of olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
    
    2. Add 8 ounces of Italian sausage to the skillet and cook until browned and cooked through, stirring occasionally and breaking it up into small pieces with a wooden spoon, about 8 minutes.
    
    3. Remove sausage from the skillet and set aside on a plate.
    
    4. Reduce heat to medium and add 1/2 cup of chopped onion and 2 cloves of minced garlic to the skillet. Cook until onion softens, about 5 minutes.
    
    5. Add 8 ounces of mushrooms to the skillet and cook until mushrooms are tender and lightly browned, about 4 minutes.
    
    6. Stir in 1 cup of Arborio rice and cook for 1 minute.
    
    7. Increase heat to medium-high and add 2 1/2 cups of chicken stock. Bring to a simmer and cook, stirring occasionally, until liquid is almost absorbed and rice is tender, about 15 minutes.
    
    8. Add sausage back to the skillet and cook until sauce has reduced and thickened, about 5 minutes.
    
    9. Remove from heat and stir in 1/4 cup of grated Parmesan cheese.
    
    10. Serve risotto topped with extra Parmesan, if desired. Enjoy!
