    ### Ingredients:
    - 4-6 Chicken of the Woods mushrooms
    - 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
    - 1 cup all-purpose flour
    - 2 tablespoons olive oil

    ### Instructions:
    1. Preheat oven to 400°F.

    7. Place the chicken in the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes per side until golden brown. Flip and cook for an additional 2 minutes.
    8. Remove the chicken from the skillet and set aside onto a plate.
