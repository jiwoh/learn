# Instructions

## Porcini Mushroom and Vegetable Lasagna Instructions
    1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
    2. Grease a 9-inch square baking dish with butter.
    3. In a bowl, mix together porcini mushrooms, onion, carrots, celery, garlic, oregano, salt and pepper. Set aside.
    4. In a medium skillet, heat olive oil over medium-high heat. Add the mushroom mixture and cook, stirring occasionally, for about 10 minutes until the vegetables are tender. Set aside.
    5. In a small bowl, combine ricotta cheese, parmesan cheese, parsley, basil, oregano, salt and pepper. Set aside.
    6. In a medium saucepan, melt the butter over medium-high heat. Add the flour and cook, stirring constantly, for 1 minute. Slowly add the milk, whisking constantly to avoid lumps. Bring to a boil and cook, stirring constantly, until thickened. Remove from heat and stir in the mozzarella cheese.
    7. To assemble the lasagna, spread 1/2 cup of sauce in the bottom of the prepared dish. Top with 3 lasagna noodles and spread 1/2 the ricotta cheese mixture over them. Top with 1/2 the mushroom and vegetable mixture. Sprinkle 1/3 cup of mozzarella cheese over top.
    8. Repeat layering with 3 more lasagna noodles, remaining ricotta cheese mixture, remaining mushroom and vegetable mixture, and 2/3 cup of mozzarella cheese. Top with remaining 3 lasagna noodles and sauce. Sprinkle with remaining 1/3 cup of mozzarella cheese.
    9. Cover with foil and bake for 40 minutes. Remove foil and bake for an additional 10 minutes or until cheese is melted and bubbly. Let cool for 15 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
