# Instructions

## Black Trumpet Mushroom and Chicken Marsala
    
    ### Ingredients:
    * 4 boneless, skinless chicken breasts
    * 1/2 cup all-purpose flour
    * 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
    * 1/4 cup butter
    * 1 shallot, minced
    * 10 ounces black trumpet mushrooms
    * 1 garlic clove, minced
    * 1/2 cup Marsala wine
    * 2 tablespoons fresh thyme leaves
    * 2 tablespoons minced flat-leaf parsley
    * Salt and freshly ground pepper
    
    ### Instructions:
     1. Place the chicken breasts between 2 pieces of plastic wrap, and pound until they are an even thickness, about 1/2-inch thick.
    2. Place the flour in a shallow bowl and season with salt and pepper. Coat the chicken breasts in the flour, shaking off any excess.
    3. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicken and cook until golden, turning once, about 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate.
    4. Melt the butter in the pan. Add the shallot and mushrooms; reduce the heat to medium. Cook until the mushrooms are softened, about 5 minutes.
    5. Add the garlic and cook until fragrant, about 1 minute.
    6. Pour in the Marsala wine and simmer until the liquid is reduced by about half.
    7. Return the chicken to the pan and cook until cooked through, about 5 minutes.
    8. Remove the pan from the heat and stir in the thyme, parsley, and salt and pepper to taste.
    9. Serve the chicken with the mushrooms and sauce spooned over the top. Enjoy!
