# Instructions

## King Trumpet Mushroom and Truffle Pizza
    1. Preheat oven to 500°F (260°C). 
    2. Grease a 12-inch (30 cm) pizza pan with cooking oil spray.
    3. In a bowl, mix together 1¼ cup warm water, 1 teaspoon sugar, and ½ teaspoon active dry yeast. Let mixture sit for 5 minutes until bubbles form on top.
    4. In a separate bowl, mix together 3 cups all-purpose flour and 1 teaspoon salt. 
    5. Slowly add the yeast mixture to the flour and salt mixture and combine until the dough comes together. Knead the dough on a lightly floured surface for 5 minutes or until it is smooth and elastic.
    6. Place the ball of dough in an oiled bowl and cover with a cloth. Let rise for 30 minutes in a warm place until it doubles in size.
    7. Punch the dough down then roll out to a 12" circle on a lightly floured surface.
    8. Place the pizza dough onto the prepared pizza pan.
    9. In a skillet, heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high heat. Add 8 ounces of sliced king trumpet mushroom and ½ teaspoon of chopped garlic to the skillet and cook for 4 minutes until the mushrooms are lightly browned.
    10. Spread ¾ cup of your favorite pizza sauce onto the pizza dough.
    11. Top the pizza with the cooked mushrooms, 1 cup of sliced mozzarella cheese, and 2 tablespoons of shaved truffle.
    12. Place the pizza in the preheated oven and bake for 15 minutes, or until the crust is golden brown and cheese is melted.
    13. Remove from oven, slice, and serve. Enjoy!
