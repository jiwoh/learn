Stir everything together to completely coat the ingredients. Cover, and place in the refrigerator for at least 30 minutes.
    
    2. Heat a large skillet over medium high heat. Add the marinated chicken, mushrooms, and onion. Cook for 5-7 minutes, stirring occasionally, until the chicken is cooked through.
    
    3. Meanwhile, prepare the other ingredients. Heat a separate skillet over medium heat, and warm the tortillas on both sides. Cut the bell pepper and avocado into thin strips.
    
    4. To assemble the fajitas, place a few strips of chicken and mushrooms on each tortilla. Top with bell pepper, avocado, and a dollop of sour cream. Serve with lime wedges. Enjoy!
