# Ingredients

# Mushroom and onion tart with goat cheese Ingredients
    - 2 tablespoons olive oil
    - 1 medium onion, thinly sliced
    - 1/2 teaspoon dried oregano
    - 2 cloves garlic, minced 
    - 1/4 teaspoon red pepper flakes
    - 1/4 teaspoon black pepper
    - 2 cups mushrooms, sliced
    - 2 tablespoons fresh thyme, chopped
    - 1 (14.1-ounce) package refrigerated pie crusts
    - 8 ounces soft goat cheese, crumbled
    - 2 tablespoons grated Parmesan cheese
    - 2 tablespoons heavy cream or milk

# Instructions

###Ingredients
    - 2 tablespoons vegetable oil
    - 1 onion, chopped
    - 2 cloves garlic, chopped
    - 8 ounces mushrooms, sliced
    - Salt and pepper
    - 1 sheet prepared puff pastry
    - 4 ounces goat cheese, crumbled
    - 1 egg, beaten
    
    ###Directions
    1. Preheat oven to 375°F.
    2. Heat oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add onion and garlic and sauté until softened, about 5 minutes.
    3. Add mushrooms and season with salt and pepper. Cook until softened and most of the liquid has evaporated, about 5 minutes. Remove from heat and let cool.
    4. Roll out puff pastry on a lightly floured surface to a 10-inch square. Using a sharp knife, cut out a 9-inch circle and place it on a parchment-lined baking sheet.
    5. Spread cooled mushroom mixture over the puff pastry, leaving a ½-inch border. Sprinkle the goat cheese over the top.
    6. Fold the edges of the puff pastry up and over the filling, pleating it as needed to form a tart. Brush the edges with the beaten egg.
    7. Bake for 25 minutes, or until the pastry is golden brown. Let cool before serving.
