# Instructions

## Chanterelle Mushroom and Caramelized Onion Quiche Instructions
    
    1. Preheat oven to 375°F (190°C).
    
    2. Begin caramelizing the onions: Heat 2 tablespoons of butter and 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat. When melted, add chopped onions and a sprinkle of salt. Cook slowly, stirring occasionally, for 15-20 minutes until the onions are deep golden-brown.
    
    3. Meanwhile, prepare the quiche shell. Roll out the pastry dough on a lightly floured surface and transfer it to a 9-inch (23 cm) tart pan. Gently press the dough into the sides and bottom of the pan and trim away any excess. Prick the bottom of the dough with a fork. Refrigerate for 30 minutes or until the dough is firm.
    
    4. Bake the quiche shell on the center rack of the oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and allow to cool.
    
    5. Add the remaining tablespoon of butter to the skillet with the caramelized onions and add the chanterelle mushrooms. Cook for 5-7 minutes, until the mushrooms are softened and lightly browned.
    
    6. In a large bowl, whisk together the eggs, cream, and thyme until combined. Stir in the caramelized onions and mushrooms and season with salt and pepper.
    
    7. Pour the egg mixture into the pre-baked tart shell and bake in the oven for 25-30 minutes, or until the center is just set.
    
    8. Let the quiche cool slightly before serving. Enjoy!
