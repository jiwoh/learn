# Instructions

## Shiitake Mushroom and Pork Dumplings Instructions
    
    1. In a medium bowl, combine ground pork, shiitake mushrooms, scallions, soy sauce, sesame oil, ginger, garlic and salt. Mix until ingredients are evenly distributed. 
    
    2. Take a small spoonful of the pork mixture and place it in the center of the dumpling wrapper.
    
    3. Wet the edges of the wrapper with a finger dipped in water. This will help seal the dumpling.
    
    4. Gently fold the wrapper into a half moon shape, sealing the edges together.
    
    5. Pinch the edges of the wrapper to ensure a tight seal.
    
    6. Repeat the process with the remaining wrappers and pork mixture.
    
    7. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. 
    
    8. Add vegetable oil to the pan and swirl the oil to coat the bottom of the skillet. 
    
    9. Place the dumplings in the skillet and cook for 2-3 minutes until the bottoms are golden brown and crisp.
    
    10. Add water to the skillet until it reaches halfway up the sides of the dumplings. 
    
    11. Cover the skillet and reduce the heat to medium-low.
    
    12. Allow the dumplings to cook for 8-10 minutes or until the pork is cooked through.
    
    13. Serve the dumplings warm with soy sauce for dipping. Enjoy!
