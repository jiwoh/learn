# Instructions

## Maitake Mushroom and Asparagus Tart Instructions
    
    1. Preheat oven to 400째F (200째C).
    
    2. To prepare crust, in a medium bowl, combine 1-3/4 cups (220 g) all-purpose flour, 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) salt and 1/2 teaspoon (1 g) sugar.
    
    3. Cut 1/2 cup (113 g) cold unsalted butter into small cubes and add it to the flour mixture. Use your fingertips to cut the butter into the flour until it resembles coarse meal.
    
    4. Add 2 tablespoons (30 ml) cold water and stir until the mixture just comes together.
    
    5. Gently knead the dough on a lightly floured surface a few times until it comes together.
    
    6. Flatten the dough into a disc and wrap it in plastic wrap. Refrigerate the dough for at least 30 minutes.
    
    7. Roll out the dough on a lightly floured surface into a 12-inch (30-cm) circle. Transfer the dough to a 9-inch (23-cm) tart pan, pressing it into the corners. Trim off any excess dough.
    
    8. Prick the bottom of the tart with a fork. Line the tart shell with parchment paper and fill it with dried beans or another type of baking weight.
    
    9. Bake the tart shell for 15 minutes, then remove the parchment paper and baking weights. Continue baking for an additional 10 minutes, or until golden brown.
    
    10. Meanwhile, prepare the filling. In a large bowl, combine 1/2 pound (228 g) maitake mushrooms, 1 pound (454 g) asparagus, 2 tablespoons (30 ml) extra-virgin olive oil, and 1/2 teaspoon (2.5 g) each of salt and freshly ground black pepper.
    
    11. Spread the vegetables over the bottom of the tart shell.
    
    12. In a medium bowl, whisk together 3 large eggs, 1/2 cup (120 ml) heavy cream, 1 teaspoon (2 g) chopped fresh thyme and 1/4 teaspoon (1 g) nutmeg.
    
    13. Pour the egg mixture over the vegetables.
    
    14. Bake the tart at 400째F (200째C) for 25 to 30 minutes, or until the center is set.
    
    15. Let cool for 10 minutes before serving. Enjoy!
