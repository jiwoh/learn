# Instructions

## Porcini Mushroom and Beef Wellington Instructions 
    
    1. Preheat the oven to 375°F (190°C).
    
    2. To make the mushroom duxelles, heat a large, heavy-bottomed skillet over medium heat. Add the butter and olive oil and heat until melted. 
    
    3. Add the mushrooms, shallot, garlic, thyme and a pinch of salt. Cook, stirring occasionally, until everything is tender and the mushrooms are lightly browned, about 10 minutes. 
    
    4. Remove from heat and set aside to cool.
    
    5. To prepare the beef, season the filet mignon with salt and pepper.
    
    6. Heat a large skillet over medium-high heat. Add a little oil and when hot, add the filet mignon and sear for about 3 minutes per side. Remove from heat and let cool.
    
    7. To assemble the Wellington, lay out a large sheet of parchment paper and top with a piece of puff pastry. 
    
    8. Spread the cooled mushroom duxelles over the puff pastry, leaving about a 1-inch border. 
    
    9. Arrange the bacon slices on top of the mushrooms.
    
    10. Place the filet mignon at the middle of the puff pastry and top with the remaining bacon.
    
    11. Brush the edges of the puff pastry with the egg wash.
    
    12. Fold the edges of the puff pastry over the beef, pressing firmly to seal.
    
    13. Trim any excess puff pastry, if desired.
    
    14. Place the beef Wellington on a parchment-lined baking sheet and brush the top with the egg wash.
    
    15. Bake in the preheated oven for 30 minutes, or until golden brown and the internal temperature of the beef reaches at least 135°F (57°C).
    
    16. Remove from oven and let rest for 10 minutes before slicing and serving. Enjoy!
