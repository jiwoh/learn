# Instructions

## Portobello Mushroom and Black Bean Enchiladas Instructions
    
    1. Preheat the oven to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C).
    
    2. Heat 1 tablespoon of olive oil in a medium skillet over medium-high heat. Add the mushrooms and cook, stirring occasionally, until they are slightly shrunken and beginning to brown, about 8 minutes.
    
    3. In a small bowl, whisk together the enchilada sauce, garlic, cumin, and coriander.
    
    4. Spread about 1/4 cup of the enchilada sauce mixture in the bottom of a 9x13 inch baking dish.
    
    5. Heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil in the same skillet over medium-high heat. Add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until it is softened, about 5 minutes.
    
    6. Add the jalapeno, black beans, and cooked mushrooms to the skillet with the onion and cook, stirring occasionally, until the mixture begins to thicken, about 5 minutes.
    
    7. To assemble the enchiladas, spread about 1/4 cup of the enchilada sauce mixture down the center of each tortilla. Spoon some of the bean and mushroom mixture onto the sauce and roll the tortilla up. Place seam side down in the baking dish.
    
    8. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the enchiladas, distributing it evenly. Sprinkle the shredded cheese over the top.
    
    9. Bake in the preheated oven until the enchiladas are heated through, the sauce is bubbling and the cheese is melted, about 25 minutes.
