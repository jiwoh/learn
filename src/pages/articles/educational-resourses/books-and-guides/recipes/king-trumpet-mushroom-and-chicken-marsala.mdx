# Instructions

### King Trumpet Mushroom and Chicken Marsala Recipe
    
    #### Ingredients
    - 2 tablespoons olive oil
    - 2 boneless, skinless chicken breasts, cut into thin strips
    - Salt and pepper, to taste
    - 2 tablespoons butter
    - 1/2 yellow onion, finely diced
    - 2 cloves garlic, finely minced
    - 2 cups King Trumpet mushrooms, sliced
    - 1/3 cup Marsala wine
    - 1/3 cup chicken broth
    - 1/4 teaspoon dried thyme
    - 2 tablespoons chopped fresh parsley
    
    #### Instructions
    1. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat.
    2. Season the chicken with salt and pepper, and cook in the hot oil until lightly golden and cooked through, about 5 minutes. Transfer the chicken to a plate and set aside.
    3. Reduce the heat to medium and add the butter to the skillet. Add the onion and garlic, and cook until the onion is softened, about 3 minutes.
    4. Increase the heat to medium-high and add the mushrooms. Cook, stirring, for about 5 minutes, until the mushrooms are lightly browned.
    5. Add the Marsala wine and scrape up any browned bits from the bottom of the pan. Add the chicken broth, thyme, and season with salt and pepper, to taste. Place the chicken back into the skillet and stir to combine.
    6. Simmer until the sauce is slightly reduced and thickened, about 10 minutes. Sprinkle with the fresh parsley and serve. Enjoy!
