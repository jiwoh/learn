  # Introduction

# Mushroom Enchiladas
    
    ## Origin and History 
    The origin of mushroom enchiladas is unclear - there is evidence of similar dishes being served in Mexico as early as the 16th century. While traditional mushroom enchiladas are made with tortillas and a red Chile sauce, the modern version has evolved to include other ingredients like sour cream, garlic, onions and cheese. Today, the dish is popular all over the world and can be customized to suit a variety of tastes.

# Mushroom Enchiladas Instructions
    
    1. Preheat the oven to 350Â°F.
    
    2. Heat a large pan over medium heat. Add 1 tablespoon of oil, 2 cloves of minced garlic, 1 diced onion, and 1 package of diced mushrooms. Saute until the vegetables are softened and the mushrooms have released their juices, about 5 minutes.
    
    3. Remove the vegetables from the pan and set aside.
    
    4. Add 1 tablespoon of oil to the pan and heat. Add 1 can of red enchilada sauce and 1 cup of water. Simmer for 5 minutes.
    
    5. Spread a thin layer of the enchilada sauce in an oven-safe pan.
    
    6. In a mixing bowl, combine the cooked vegetables, 1 cup of shredded cheese, and 1/4 cup of chopped cilantro.
    
    7. Divide the mixture among 8 flour tortillas, roll each tortilla, and place seam side down in the pan.
    
    8. Pour the remaining enchilada sauce over the rolled enchiladas. Sprinkle with remaining cheese.
    
    9. Bake for 25 minutes, until the enchiladas are golden and the cheese is melted. Serve with sour cream, chopped emerald onions, and lime wedges. Enjoy!
