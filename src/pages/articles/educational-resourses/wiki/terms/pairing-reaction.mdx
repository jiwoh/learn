# Pairing reaction
    Pairing reaction is a phenomenon in which two haploid mycelial lines of genetically compatible fungi, each derived from a single ascospore, form a dikaryotic mycelium (a mycelium containing two separate nuclei per cell).
    
    ## Significance in Mycology
    Pairing reaction is an important process in mycology, as it is the crucial first step in the formation of a dikaryotic mycelium. This is the most common form of mycelium in most ascomycete fungi and is important for the generation of sexual spores, which are necessary for the survival of the species. Additionally, the compatible pairs of nuclei found in dikaryotic mycelia are important for heterokaryon incompatibility, which is the process in which incompatible mycelia are rejected by each other during pairing reactions.

# Usage

Pairing reaction has become a valuable tool for mycologists, as it allows for the rapid identification and classification of fungi. On a practical level, the use of Pairing reaction enables mycologists to identify and compare the mycelial morphology of different fungi in order to identify species and strain differences. This method is especially useful in research studies where the identification of a particular fungus is essential, since it has a much higher accuracy than other available methods. In addition, Pairing reaction is highly cost-effective and can be used in laboratory settings with relative ease. As such, Pairing reaction is a valuable tool for mycologists, as it makes the identification and comparison of fungal species and strains much easier and more reliable.

# Example

The Pairing reaction has been widely used to study the genetic interactions and relationships of fungi, mushrooms, and other fungal species. This technique has been employed to investigate the phylogenetic relationships between taxa and the ecology, systematics and biogeography of fungi. For example, pairing reaction has been used to study the mating type determination of mushrooms, which is essential for understanding both the genetics and evolutionary biology of the species. Additionally, pairing reaction has been applied in the production of food because it can be used to detect the presence of fungi in food products and to ascertain the safety of consumption.
