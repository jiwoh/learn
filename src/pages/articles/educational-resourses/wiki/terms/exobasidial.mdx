## Definition
    
    Exobasidial is a type of fungal hyphae characterized by an outer wall composed of chitin and an inner layer of septate structures. The septate structures are composed of two cells joined together, each held together by a cell wall. Exobasidial hyphae are typically found in mushrooms, rusts and smuts.
    
    ## Significance to Mycology 
    
    Exobasidial hyphae are important to mycologists because they are the main form of fungal tissue that can be observed through a microscope. Microscopic observation of the structure of the septate cell walls and the chitinous outer wall provide insight into the taxonomic and evolutionary relationships among different species of fungi. Additionally, the presence of Exobasidial hyphae can be used to identify pathogenic species of fungi that can cause disease in humans and crops.

# Usage

Exobasidial is an important tool used in mycology research and applied mycology. It offers the ability to identify, quantify, and analyze fungal species and their related metabolites. Such analyses can be used to gain insights into the ecology, biochemistry, and phylogeny of fungi, and to provide data to better inform production and management strategies. Additionally, Exobasidial can be employed as a diagnostic tool to help identify fungal species that may cause human or animal diseases, and provide insights into disease transmission and control methods. Finally, Exobasidial can be used to support drug and natural product discovery, enabling research into new treatments for fungal diseases.

# Example

Exobasidial is an advanced method of studying fungi and mushrooms, and is widely used in mycology, mushroom cultivation, and mushroom consumption. This method utilizes high resolution imaging and precise laboratory techniques, such as mass spectrometry, to analyze and identify fungal species and understand their biochemical properties. Exobasidial provides a detailed look at the anatomy and chemistry of the fungi, allowing researchers to gain greater insight into their growth, utilization, and environmental suitability. For example, researchers have used Exobasidial to assess the nutritional value of different mushroom species and identify the optimal growth conditions for cultivation. Additionally, Exobasidial can be used to discern the presence of toxins or allergens within fungi, making it a valuable tool for assessing the safety and quality of mushrooms for human consumption.
