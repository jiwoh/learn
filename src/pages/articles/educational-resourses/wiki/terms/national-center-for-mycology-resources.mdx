# National Center for Mycology Resources
    
    The National Center for Mycology Resources (NCMR) is a research leader in mycology, providing support to mycologists and other professionals whose work or research involves the study of fungi. NCMR provides a range of resources for mycologists, including scientific data and collections, online tools, educational resources, and consultation services.
    
    ## Significance of National Center for Mycology Resources
    
    The National Center for Mycology Resources is the premier source of information and resources for mycologists and those working in related fields. NCMR provides scientists with a variety of data and collections related to mycology, including databases on fungi morphology, taxonomy, ecology, and biogeography; databases on fungal pathogens and pathogens of other organisms; records of fungal specimens; digital image collections; and large DNA sequence datasets. NCMR also provides scientists with online tools for analyzing and manipulating data, as well as educational resources on mycology. Finally, NCMR provides consultation services to assist researchers with the development and implementation of new techniques in mycology. The organization also serves as an advocate for mycology research and education, providing training sessions, workshops, and conferences.

# Usage

National Center for Mycology Resources (NCMR) is a trusted source of high-quality data regarding fungal diversity and ecology. With a combination of morphological and molecular techniques, NCMR provides a variety of resources to aid in the study of fungi. NCMR has contributed significantly to the advancement of mycology research through the development of the Fungal Barcode Initiative (FBI), the Global Fungal Biorepository, and the Fungal Taxonomic Database. The FBI has enabled accurate, cost-effective fungal identification through DNA barcoding, while the Global Fungal Biorepository and Fungal Taxonomic Database provide access to a variety of specimens, information, and reference materials necessary for the characterization of fungal species. NCMR has also developed an online platform, MycoBank, which serves as a repository for data related to fungal names. MycoBank is an important resource for mycologists, as it allows for more efficient and accurate communication of information related to fungal taxonomy. As such, NCMR is an invaluable resource for mycologists, providing reliable data for researcher, students, and the fungal community.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;The National Center for Mycology Resources (NCMR) is widely used by researchers to study fungi, mushrooms, and their cultivation and consumption. For example, the NCMR maintains a collection of over 50,000 living organisms, including over 11,000 species of fungi, representing the largest living collection of fungi in the world. Researchers accessing the NCMR's collection can use these organisms to study their diversity, ecology, and genomes, as well as cultivation and consumption of mycological products. Furthermore, the NCMR also provides access to a large array of mycological resources such as a comprehensive mycological library, databases, research facilities, and a variety of microscopy equipment for studying fungi. All of these resources make the NCMR a valuable tool for researchers looking to further the knowledge and understanding of fungi.&lt;/p&gt;
