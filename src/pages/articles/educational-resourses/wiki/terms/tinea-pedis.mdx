# Definition of Tinea Pedis
    
    Tinea pedis, commonly known as athlete's foot, is a fungal infection of the skin on the feet caused by a type of fungus called dermatophytes. The fungus thrives in warm and moist environments and is usually contracted by direct contact with the fungus or indirect contact, such as through contact with surfaces that have been previously contaminated with the fungus.
    
    # Significance of Tinea Pedis to Mycology
    
    Tinea pedis is an important fungal infection in mycology as it affects millions of people around the world each year and can lead to severe skin damage if left untreated. The infection is especially common in warm and humid regions, which is why it is often referred to as “athlete’s foot”. Understanding the biology of the infection and the different species of fungi that can cause it is essential for physicians and mycologists to effectively diagnose and treat tinea pedis.

# Usage

Tinea pedis is a clinically important fungus that is commonly used in mycology to diagnose a number of different fungal infections. It is known to cause interdigital dermatitis, a condition characterized by pruritic, scaly lesions on the feet, and is often the underlying cause of athlete's foot, jock itch, and other dermatologic illnesses. In the laboratory, Tinea pedis is used in both clinical and research settings to examine the pathogenic potential of other fungal species and to provide insight into the epidemiology of other common fungal infections. Additionally, by studying the virulence, population structure, and drug susceptibility of Tinea pedis, mycologists are able to provide novel treatments for related infections.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;Tinea pedis is a common dermatophyte fungal infection of the feet popularly known as athlete’s foot. This infection is often studied to understand how dermatophytes interact with their host environment in order to gain insight into the infection mechanisms of other dermatophytes. This can be beneficial in the development of treatments for other fungal infections, such as ringworm, caused by dermatophytes. Furthermore, scientists have applied the study of Tinea pedis to understand the epidemiology and population genetics of dermatophytes for mushroom species of commercial interest.&lt;/p&gt;
