# Definition
    
    Intercalary is a group of hyphal growth tips within a fungal hyphae cell which divides to form secondary branches and create further extension of the hyphae. 
    
    # Significance
    
    Intercalary is an essential part of the mycelium growth process in fungi, making them essential to the study of mycology. Intercalary growth is required for fungi to grow, expand, and move through substrates. As the fungi grows, intercalary tips stimulate the generation of secondary hyphal branches, eventually creating the mycelium. Thus, intercalary play an integral role in allowing fungi to live and grow in their environment.

# Usage

Intercalary is an important concept in mycology research, as it is a method of counting the growth of hyphae. Hyphae are filaments found in fungi, and their growth can provide a great deal of insight into the life cycles and behaviors of various fungal species. Intercalary counts measure the formation and growth of hyphae by counting the number of cells in a certain length of hypha. This data is then used to inform research on the interactions between species and between fungi and other organisms. In addition, intercalary counts are used to assess the health and vigor of fungi populations, as well as to identify fungi that may contain beneficial compounds. Thus, intercalary counts are essential to understanding the diversity and behavior of fungi.

# Example

Intercalary is widely used to study the ecology of fungi, mushrooms, and their cultivation or consumption. For example, mycologists use Intercalary to monitor changes in the biomass of different species over time. By tracking biomass production and growth cycles, it is possible to gain insight into a range of important ecological characteristics, such as competition or predation between species, as well as the roles that different fungi and mushrooms play in their ecosystems. Intercalary can also be used to assess the effectiveness of different mushroom cultivation techniques, which is crucial for the sustainable production of mushrooms for consumption.
