# Definition
    
    Reniform fungi are fungi that grow in globular or rounded shapes resembling human kidneys. The term comes from the Latin words for “kidney” and “shape”. 
    
    # Significance
    
    Reniform fungi is an important group of fungi that can be found in a variety of environments. Reniform fungi are most often found in soil and are important decomposers of organic material. Some species of reniform fungi are edible and are used in various cuisines. Reniform fungi is also used in scientific research, including studies of the ecology of soil and other environments.

# Usage

Reniform is a commonly used technique in mycology for the identification of fungal species. This well-established technique involves the observation of the spore-forming structures of the fungal spores in order to accurately identify the species. Reniform is also used as a valuable tool in research, as it allows for the comparison of different fungal species in order to identify any possible differences in morphology and/or genetic structure. This can be especially helpful when studying the evolution of certain species or the relationships among species. Furthermore, Reniform can be used to provide valuable insight into potentially novel species that were previously unknown, aiding in the exploration of new genetic and morphological characteristics.

# Example

Reniform is widely used in mycology and mushroom cultivation as a method of identifying different species of fungi. It is based on the observation of the fruiting bodies of mushrooms and other fungi, which can take various forms: for example, the caps of mushrooms, puffballs, and other fungi may be spheroid, cylindrical, and even oblong, with a kidney-shaped depression at the apex. Additionally, the surface of the fruit bodies may be smooth, tomentose (covered in dense, tangled flexible hairs), or scaly. This information can be used to match the specimen with a known species, enabling a mycologist to make an accurate identification.
