## Definition
    
    Dermatophytosis, also known as ringworm, is a fungal infection of the skin, hair, or nails caused by dermatophytes. Dermatophyte infections are contagious and can spread from person to person, animal to person, or from contaminated objects such as towels, bedding, and clothing.
    
    ## Significance of Dermatophytosis 
    
    In mycology, Dermatophytosis is important to study to understand the various fungal infections of the skin, hair, and nails caused by dermatophytes and other fungal species. It is also important to study the epidemiology of Dermatophytosis to better understand the transmission and prevalence of these infections. This information is crucial to help develop public health policies, prevention strategies, and treatments.

# Usage

Dermatophytosis is a type of fungal infection caused by dermatophytes, which are a group of fungi that cause infection of the skin, hair, and nails. Dermatophytosis is a common skin disease in both humans and animals, and is the most frequent cause of fungal skin diseases worldwide. In mycology, it is used to study the pathology of the lesions produced by the fungi that cause the disease, as well as the response of the immune system to them. Furthermore, it is used to develop more effective antifungal treatments and to better understand how the fungi cause and spread the infection. Understanding the pathology of infections caused by dermatophytes is important to develop targeted and safe treatments for this type of fungal infection.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;Dermatophytosis is a fungal infection of the skin caused by a group of common filamentous fungi known as dermatophytes. These dermatophytes are ubiquitously found in soil, decaying organic matter, and other moist environments. Recently, dermatophytes have been identified as the causative agents of some foodborne illnesses, and have been used for the study of mushrooms and other fungi in their cultivation or consumption. For example, Dermatophilus congolensis is a dermatophyte species that is widely used in mushroom cultivation, as its presence helps promote mushroom growth and overall quality. Additionally, species of Trichophyton and Microsporium have been used to study the production of edible mushrooms, as they are often present in the fruiting, sporulating, and reproductive tissues of mushrooms.&lt;/p&gt;
