## Definition
    
    Lichenin is an exopolysaccharide that is produced by species of lichenized fungi. It is composed of ribose, glucose, and mannose molecules that are crosslinked by Î²-1,4 glycosidic bonds.
    
    ## Significance
    
    Lichenin is an important component of the lichen thallus, providing structural rigidity and helping to protect the organism from abiotic stressors. It also helps support the fungus in its symbiotic relationship with the photosynthetic partner, allowing the lichen to survive in challenging environments. Furthermore, lichenin has been used in biomedical applications, such as wound healing and drug delivery.

# Usage

Lichenin is a major component of lichen thalli and is an important source of carbon in many terrestrial and aquatic environments. In mycology, lichenin is an important factor in the identification of different genera and species of lichens, as its distinctive branching patterns are often diagnostic. Additionally, lichenin has been used as an indicator of air quality, as it is easily impacted by air pollutants such as sulfur dioxide, ozone and nitrogen oxides, allowing for the quick and efficient identification of air pollution sources. In research, lichenin is a useful biomarker for the detection of mycoplasma-infected lichens, providing increased accuracy and sensitivity compared to traditional culturing methods. Finally, lichenin has also been used as a potential plant growth promoting agent, lending its potential to various areas of agriculture and plant science.

# Example

Lichenin is a polysaccharide found in the cell walls of many species of lichens, and is commonly used as an indicator of fungal biomass. Its presence in fungi has been known to predict their ability to be cultivated and consumed. Specifically, studies have demonstrated that the presence of lichenin in the cell walls of mushrooms is important for determining their edibility, as it thickens the cell wall and improves the texture and flavor of the mushrooms. Additionally, lichenin has been used as an indicator of biomass in mushroom mycelium, with higher levels correlated with greater yields of fruiting bodies. As such, lichenin is a useful tool for mycologists studying and cultivating mushrooms.
