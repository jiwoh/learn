## Definition
    
    Mucoromycota is a phylum of fungi within the kingdom Fungi. It includes both Zygomycota and Glomeromycota, but not Basidiomycota nor Ascomycota. Most Mucoromycota are saprobes, meaning they live off dead organic matter, however some species are parasites in animals and plants. 
    
    ## Significance
    
    Mucoromycota are an important part of the fungal kingdom and are found in almost every environment. They are well studied due to their ability to degrade a wide variety of organic substrates, their presence in crop and pasture systems, and their role in the food and pharmaceutical industries. Furthermore, Mucoromycota provide insight into the evolutionary history of Fungi and have several species that have been used as model organisms in research.

# Usage

Mucoromycota is a class of fungi widely used in the fields of biotechnology, food and feed production, environmental remediation, and medicine. Its prominent role in biotechnology has been established through the production of valuable proteins, enzymes, and bioactive compounds, which can be produced and optimized through the use of genetic engineering techniques. Additionally, Mucoromycota species have been used as important tools for advancing knowledge in microbial ecology, as well as for the development of appropriate methods for the control of fungal diseases. Finally, Mucoromycota species are important sources of essential nutrients such as vitamins, minerals, and other bioactive compounds, and are used in a wide range of food and feed production. All of these applications demonstrate the great potential of Mucoromycota classes and highlight the need for further research into their full utilization.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;Mucoromycota is widely used to study mushrooms, specifically those belonging to the genus Agaricus. These mushrooms are important for both their culinary use and for their potential in bioprocessing applications. Research into the production of more Agaricus species has widely relied on Mucoromycota due to their ability to act as biotransformers of lignocellulosic substrates, which are the main component of mushroom mycelium. In addition, Mucoromycota can also be used as inoculum to accelerate the growth of Agaricus mushroom mycelium. The use of Mucoromycota for the production of Agaricus mushrooms has enabled the development of new mushroom varieties with increased yield, improved nutritive value, and better flavor.
