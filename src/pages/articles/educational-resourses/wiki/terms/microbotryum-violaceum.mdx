# Microbotryum violaceum
    
    Microbotryum violaceum is a plant pathogenic fungus, belonging to the order Capnodiales, which infects a range of species in the Caryophyllaceae family, including Dianthus and Silene species. The fungus forms small, club-shaped telial spores on the flowers of infected plants, which produce the neurotoxin violacein when the spore-bearing structures (acervuli) mature.
    
    ## Significance of Microbotryum violaceum to Mycology
    
    Microbotryum violaceum is an important plant pathogen, whose study can provide insight into the dynamics of microbial interactions in natural systems. As a member of the order Capnodiales, the fungus provides an insight into many common fungal traits, such as the production of both asexual and sexual spores, that are applicable to the understanding of other fungi and the role they play in plant pathology. Furthermore, the production of violacein by the fungus can provide insight into the evolution of toxins in fungi, as well as their possible utilization in other fields, such as biocontrol and bioremediation.

# Usage

Microbotryum violaceum is a species of filamentous ascomycete fungi commonly found in grasses. It is the causative agent of anther smut disease, which is a serious disease that affects grass species and reduces crop yields. Research has shown that Microbotryum violaceum has potential applications in plant breeding as a biocontrol agent. Specifically, this species may be used to produce transgenic crops that are resistant to anther smut disease and other fungal infections. Furthermore, due to its unique biology and genetics, Microbotryum violaceum is used in genetic and evolutionary research to further our understanding of host-pathogen interactions and disease dynamics.

# Example

Microbotryum violaceum is widely used to study the micro-evolution of fungi, particularly within the mushroom species. For example, research studies have used M. violaceum to detect and identify single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) in a number of fungal taxa. SNPs are useful for detecting differences in gene expression and evolutionary changes over time, as they are the most common type of genetic variation among species. Furthermore, the presence of SNPs can also be used to accurately map out the genetic relationships between different mushroom species, as well as to develop new methods of mushroom cultivation and consumption.
