# Definition 
    
    Lenticular is the term used to describe a genus of fungi that includes members of the Ascomycota phylum and are related to lichens. They are characterized by their thin, dark, disc-shaped fruiting bodies, often growing on thin stalks in clusters.
    
    # Significance 
    
    Lenticular fungi are an important part of mycology, as they are found in a variety of habitats around the world. They are often used as an indicator of air quality and pollution levels, as they are sensitive to airborne pollutants. Lenticular fungi are also used as food sources for milking caterpillars, and for their special properties that can be used in the production of medicine and other products.

# Usage

Lenticular technology is used to image and characterize three-dimensional (3D) morphologies of fungal colonies and spores. This provides structured, quantitative analysis of fungal shape, with applications to taxonomy, phylogenetics, and ecology. Such analysis aids in the identification of species, in comparison of morphological characteristics between species, and in the identification of new species. Lenticular imaging is also used to study the formation and development of fungal fruiting bodies, helping to understand the ecology and life cycles of fungi.

# Example

Lenticular microscopy has become a widely used tool in mycology research, particularly when it comes to studying fungi, mushrooms, and their cultivation or consumption. This type of microscopy involves the use of special lenses, usually referred to as "lenses of detail", that are designed to magnify fine details of the specimen, as well as to reveal structural features that would be otherwise difficult or impossible to detect with a standard microscope. For instance, by using a lenticular microscope, researchers have been able to reveal microscopic features, such as spore size and morphology, that are crucial for accurately determining the species of a given mushroom. Additionally, due to the high degree of magnification provided by lenticular microscopy, researchers have been able to examine the distribution of various pigments, such as carotenoids and chlorophyll, which are important in understanding the complex flavor and nutritional compositions of different species of mushrooms.
