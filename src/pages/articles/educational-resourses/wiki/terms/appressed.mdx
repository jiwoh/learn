# Definition
    
    Appressed, in mycology, is an adjective used to describe the state of a structure being pressed closely against another object. With fungi, appressed is commonly used when talking about the close attachment of either the fruiting body or spores to the substrate. 
    
    # Significance
    
    The specific structure of a fungus can provide valuable insight for mycologists. Appressed structures can indicate that the fungus is growing in a particular environment, is adapted to a certain physical characteristic of its substrate, or has a particular life-cycle. Understanding the nature of appressed structures can help mycologists better understand the ecosystem and the relationships between the fungi and other organisms. Appressed structures also provide clues of where a particular species of fungus is likely to be found.

# Usage

Appressed is a term used to describe the growing structure of a fungus in mycology. In practical applications, fungi with an appressed growing structure can be found tightly adhering to a substrate, often appearing flattened. Appressed growing structures are important in mycology research as they provide insight into the evolutionary adaptation of fungi, as well as the potential of fungi to spread and survive in different environmental conditions. Furthermore, these adaptations assist in the classification of fungi, allowing for accurate species identification.

# Example

Appressed is a widely used tool for researching and studying the life cycle, ecology, and biology of fungi. It is employed extensively in the cultivation and consumption of mushrooms, allowing mycologists and mushroom growers to gain insight into the various stages of mycelial growth. Appressed provides a detailed view of the mycelial web, making it possible to monitor the changes in the structure of the web over time and to gain a better understanding of its complexity. Furthermore, Appressed can be used to gain knowledge of the nutritional value and edibility of different fungi species, as well as to identify hazardous or even poisonous mushrooms.
