# Definition
    
    A Dermatophyte is a type of fungi, which is primarily responsible for causing fungal skin infections. These fungi are also responsible for hair, and nail infections. They can also cause certain types of ringworm. 
    
    # Significance
    
    Dermatophytes are significant to mycology because they are a common cause of human skin diseases. Appropriate diagnosis and treatment of dermatophyte infections is essential in order to improve patient outcomes, prevent relapse, and reduce the spread of the infection. 
    
    Dermatophyte species are also important in research and provide valuable insights into the evolution and ecology of these fungi. Understanding the biology and genetics of dermatophytes and how they interact with their environment is essential to developing effective treatments for skin diseases.

# Usage

Dermatophytes are fungi that are important for diagnosing and treating human mycoses. They typically cause superficial fungal infections, such as ringworm and athlete's foot, but can cause more severe skin, hair, and nail infections. These organisms are also associated with more systemic health problems, such as tinea versicolor and onychomycosis. The identification of these organisms often relies on classical methods such as skin scrapings and microscopic examination. Molecular techniques, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and DNA sequencing, are also increasingly being used to identify dermatophytes in clinical diagnostics. Research using dermatophytes is also helping to advance our understanding of the mechanisms of fungal infection.

# Example

Dermatophytes are widely used in mycology to study and understand the ecology of fungi, mushrooms, and their associated food sources. For example, species of Dermatophytes are often sampled and identified in the environment to better understand the mycobiome, or the diversity of mushrooms that are present. This data can be used to help inform the cultivation, harvesting, and consumption of mushrooms and other food sources. Additionally, the study of Dermatophyte species can provide insight into the characteristics, epidemiology, and life cycles of certain mushrooms, which can help inform agricultural and conservation efforts.
