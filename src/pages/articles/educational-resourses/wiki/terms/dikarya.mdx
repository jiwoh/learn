# Definition
    
    Dikarya is a large and diverse taxonomic group of fungi within the kingdom Fungi. It is composed of two major subgroups: Basidiomycota and Ascomycota.
    
    # Significance
    
    Dikarya is significant to mycology because it is the largest and most diverse subset of fungi, containing over 95% of known fungal species. These species range in form and function, from the well-known edible mushrooms to the microscopic spores found in soil, air, and water. What makes Dikarya particularly noteworthy is that these fungi are incredibly complex and play a crucial role in regulating global ecosystems. They are involved in the cycling of nutrients, breaking down organic matter, and forming symbiotic relationships with other organisms. Additionally, many species of Dikarya have been widely used in human medicine, food production, and biotechnology.

# Usage

Dikarya is a useful tool for understanding and classifying fungi within mycology. This taxonomic grouping includes both the Ascomycota and Basidiomycota phyla, both of which are essential to understanding the ecology and biodiversity of fungi. Dikarya provides an efficient classification system by categorizing them into two distinct classes, with all species being able to be further sub-classified into individual genera and species. This allows for detailed research into the ecology and biology of various fungi, and helps to inform conservation and management decisions by providing a comprehensive understanding of the distribution, abundance, and biology of fungi. Furthermore, Dikarya is invaluable in accurately and quickly identifying fungi in the field, which can be critical in determining appropriate management strategies.

# Example

Dikarya is widely used to study and identify species of fungi and mushrooms. In particular, molecular techniques based on DNA sequencing are used to compare the genetic makeup of species within the subkingdom, aiding in species identification and classification. Additionally, molecular techniques are often used to identify and quantify metabolites, such as trichloroacetic acid, associated with mushrooms and other fungi. These techniques allow for a comprehensive assessment of toxins, medicinal compounds, and other products produced by fungi and mushrooms, which aids in their cultivation and consumption.
