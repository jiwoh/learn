# Definition:
    Cirrus are a type of mushroom with a draping, delicate cap and a white, appendage-like stem.
    
    # Significance:
    Cirrus mushrooms are important in mycology because they are used to study the spread of fungal diseases and the growth of mycelium networks. They are also used to study the spread of spore reproduction and the role of mycorrhizal fungi in soil and tree growth.

# Usage

Cirrus has become an invaluable tool for mycologists in both research and practical applications. It is used to identify and classify different species of fungi, helping scientists to better understand their ecology, biology, and taxonomy. Cirrus also provides a centralized repository of molecular data that can be used to infer phylogenetic relationships between species, giving us better insight into the evolution of different fungal species over time. Additionally, Cirrus can be used to better monitor the presence of important pathogens and contaminants in food, animal products, and the environment. This information can be used to inform public health policy and help to keep populations safe from fungal diseases.

# Example

Cirrus is a powerful tool for mycologists and mushroom enthusiasts alike. It is widely used for collecting, categorizing, and analyzing data related to fungi and mushrooms. For example, it has been used to compare fungal mycelial growth rates across different substrates and light / temperature treatments, as well as track fungal fruiting body production over time. Its many features also allow users to map mushroom species distribution on a regional or global scale, identify and match unidentified species via genetic sequencing and barcoding, and generate comprehensive reports on production and consumption trends in mushroom markets.
