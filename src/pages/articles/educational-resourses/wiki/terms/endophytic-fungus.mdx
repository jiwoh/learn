## Definition of Endophytic Fungus
    
    An endophytic fungus is a type of fungus that lives inside of the cells of a living host plant. This type of fungus lives in the cells of the plant for the duration of its life cycle and does not cause any harm to the plant.
    
    ## Significance of Endophytic Fungus to Mycology
    
    Endophytic fungi play an important role in mycology because they can serve as effective indicators of plant health and help researchers understand the processes that occur within plant cells. Endophytic fungi are also of great importance to the pharmaceutical and agricultural industries, as they have the potential to produce unique secondary metabolites that could have beneficial applications in a variety of areas.

# Usage

Endophytic fungi are widely used in research to investigate the beneficial effects of symbiosis between plants and microorganisms, such as nitrogen fixation and plant growth promotion. These fungi are known to produce a range of natural compounds, including antibiotics, that may be beneficial to plants, and are believed to be involved in protecting the plants from pathogenic organisms. Endophytic fungi are also important to research in areas such as biodegradation, soil development, and pest control. As such, Endophytic fungi have become a vital component of mycology research, allowing scientists to better understand the importance of symbiosis in plant biology and ecosystem functioning.

# Example

Endophytic fungi are widely used to study the mycorrhizal, saprobic, and lichenized fungi that exist in the wild. Endophytic fungi are found within plant tissues, including leaves, stem tissues, stem base, and root tissues. Moreover, endophytic fungi are often isolated from the wild and screened for their ability to produce bioactive metabolites and enzymes, making them a valuable source for drug discovery research. For example, endophytic fungi isolated from the medicinal plant artemisia annua have demonstrated anti-microbial, anti-cancer and anti-inflammatory activities. Additionally, endophytic fungi can be used to cultivate mushrooms for consumption or improve the growth of certain plants. This is achieved by co-inoculating the endophytic fungus with the mushroom or plant organism in order to improve the growth quality and yield of the organism.
