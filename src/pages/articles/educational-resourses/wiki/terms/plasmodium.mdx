## Plasmodium
    
    Plasmodium is a genus of unicellular parasites that infect animals, including humans, and cause a variety of diseases. The genus belongs to the phylum Apicomplexa, and it is comprised of over 200 species that cause malaria in humans. Plasmodium has complicated life cycles involving both the vertebrate and invertebrate hosts.
    
    ## Significance of Plasmodium to Mycology
    
    Plasmodium is significant to mycology because it is a unicellular organism capable of causing damage to humans and other animals. Plasmodium is one of the most important pathogens in the world, and understanding its biology is essential for disease control. In addition, Plasmodium has a complex life cycle, making it an interesting organism to study from a mycological perspective.

# Usage

Plasmodium has become an important tool for mycologists to study the interactions between fungi, their environment, and other organisms. It is particularly useful for studying interkingdom interactions, such as mycoparasitism, endophyte-plant associations, lichen symbiosis, and mycorrhizal formation. Plasmodium has been used to investigate the various pathways of communication between partners in these mutualistic relationships and to identify essential enzymes, metabolites, and genetic pathways involved in the exchange of materials. For example, studies have used Plasmodium to explore the key fungal enzymes involved in nitrogen and carbon metabolism, as well as the effects of different environmental conditions on the expression of these enzymes. Additionally, Plasmodium has been used to examine the interactions between fungi and other species in mycorrhizal associations, providing valuable insights into the genetic basis of these important plant-fungal relationships.

# Example

Plasmodium is an important tool to study the physiology, taxonomy, and ecology of fungi. The species of Plasmodium, such as Plasmodiophora brassicae and Plasmodiophora lycopersici, are capable of promoting the growth of mushrooms and other fungal species, allowing for the cultivation of edible mushrooms for consumption. Additionally, Plasmodium can be used to identify fungal species by their macroscopic appearance, as different species of Plasmodium have distinct distinct morphological features. This can be used to differentiate between edible and non-edible species of fungi, ultimately aiding in their safe consumption.
