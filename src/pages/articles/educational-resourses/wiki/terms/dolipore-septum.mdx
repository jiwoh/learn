Provide an example to further explain how Dolipore septum is important to mycology.
    
   
    
    A Dolipore septum is a type of septum that divides the cytoplasm of two adjacent hyphal cells in fungi, and is formed by a primary septum.
    
    # Significance
    
    The Dolipore septum is an important feature of the hyphal cell wall in many fungi species, as it allows for the regeneration of hyphae, as well as the replication of genetic material. The Dolipore septum provides an opportunity for fungal cells to divide, reproduce and create new hyphae, and also serves as a partition for the two daughter cells to aid in the separation of the two cells after replication. It is also responsible for allowing the flow of nutrients between cells, allowing for the growth and development of the fungus.
    
    # Example
    
    An example of the significance of the Dolipore septum can be seen when studying the important fungal species, Aspergillus niger. This fungus is capable of producing a range of products and is important in the food and pharmaceutical industries because of its ability to secrete enzymes. The Dolipore septum is responsible for allowing the A. niger cells to replicate and divide at a rapid rate, allowing for the production of the desired enzymes.

# Usage

Dolipore septum is a commonly used tool in mycology to isolate and culture different fungal species. It is a hard, plastic disc with a central hole that can be used to securely attach brushes or other instruments to agar plates and other media. Dolipore septum facilitates the growth of different mycelial colonies and the formation of spores, enabling mycologists to obtain more reliable results from their studies. Additionally, it allows mycologists to obtain multiple colonies from a single source and to reduce the amount of contamination in their cultures. Thus, Dolipore septum plays an important role in mycological research, as it enables researchers to obtain more accurate results and to identify and study distinct species in greater detail.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;Dolipore septum is a selectively permeable barrier used to isolate fungal and mushroom colonies by preventing the exchange of genetic material between them. This technique is widely used to study fungi and mushrooms, as it enables researchers to create and distinguish distinct varieties of the organisms and examine their properties. For example, the Dolipore septum technique has been used to analyze the susceptibility of mushroom species to various pesticides and to determine whether their mycelia are compatible for large-scale cultivation. Additionally, researchers can use this technique to control the texture, color, and flavor of mushrooms that are consumed commercially. &lt;/p&gt;
