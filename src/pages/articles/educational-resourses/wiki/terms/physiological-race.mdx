# Definition
    
    A Physiological race is a variant of a species within a genus that differs in one or more metabolic pathways. It is usually distinguishable by its physical characteristics, such as size and shape, as well as biochemical differences, such as enzyme activity or metabolic processes.
    
    # Significance
    
    The concept of physiological race is important in mycology, as it allows us to recognize different strains of fungi and separate them into distinct categories. By studying these metabolic pathways and physical characteristics, mycologists can better understand the biology of fungi and develop better strategies to control their growth and spread. Understanding the metabolic pathways of different species of fungi can help us control their growth in environments where they could be harmful, or encourage their growth in environments where they could be beneficial. Understanding the physiological race of different species of fungi can also help us understand how they interact with other species and the environment.

# Usage

Physiological race is an important concept in mycology, as it serves as a means of classifying and distinguishing different fungal species that are closely related. Physiological race refers to the ability of two closely related species to survive in the same environment, but with different responses to environmental conditions. For example, two closely related species of mushrooms may both be found in a given area, but one may be better adapted to colder temperatures while the other is more suited to warmer temperatures. By examining the physiological responses of these closely related species, researchers can gain insight into the evolutionary history and adaptations of the species. Additionally, this knowledge can be used to improve the efficiency of genetic modification and other agricultural practices involving fungi.

# Example

Physiological race is a concept in mycology that is used to describe different isolates of the same species that are physiologically and/or morphologically distinct. This concept is widely used to study species of fungi, such as mushrooms, and their cultivation and consumption. For example, it has been used to determine the best conditions for culturing certain species of mushrooms, as well as to explore the differences in their edibility and nutritional qualities. By studying the physiology of each race in a species, mycologists can identify the most suitable mushroom varieties for various agricultural, industrial, and culinary uses.
