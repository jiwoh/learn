# Definition
    
    Dentate is a term used to describe a mushroom in which the gill attachment to the stem is formed in a toothed structure, resembling a saw blade. 
    
    # Significance
    
    The term Dentate is important to mycologists as it is used to describe the different types of gill attachment patterns found on mushrooms. This pattern of attachment allows mycologists to accurately identify different species of mushrooms and to better understand the relationships between them. Dentate is also essential for distinguishing between members of the Agaricales order and other mushrooms with similar morphologies.

# Usage

Dentate is an important tool in mycology research, providing accurate identification and classification of fungi. Dentate utilizes microscopic images and other morphological characteristics to accurately differentiate between and classify different species of fungi. This is particularly useful in research studies that aim to understand the genetic basis of species variation, as Dentate allows researchers to accurately identify species of interest and quantify differences between closely related species. In addition, Dentate is a valuable tool in evolutionary studies, as it can identify instances of horizontal gene transfer, which can be critical indicators of evolutionary history.

# Example

Dentate is a powerful tool for studying different fungi, particularly those in the Basidiomycetes family. The shape and arrangement of their dentate gills has been incredibly useful for identifying and classifying mushrooms. Dentate gill morphology is also helpful in distinguishing between edible and toxic species, as it can be used to identify the presence of dikaryotic hyphae, which can be indicative of a poisonous species. Additionally, dentate gills can provide insight into the ecology and taxonomy of a species, as they can accurately specify the type and quantity of spores that a mushroom produces. This information allows researchers to gain further understanding of a species' reproductive cycles and the environments in which it occurs.
