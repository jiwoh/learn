# Definition
    
    Papilla is a genus of fungi in the family Thelephoraceae. Papilla species are small, delicate, and have thin, thread-like stalks. They typically form small mushrooms with cup-like caps and a pallid surface.
    
    # Significance
    
    Papilla is of particular interest to mycologists because it is believed to be an evolutionary link between the primitive, "primitifungous" ancestors of most other mushroom species and their more advanced descendants. Papilla is therefore an important link in the evolutionary chain of modern day mushroom species. As such, it is an important genus of fungi to study when researching the taxonomy and morphology of modern mushrooms.

# Usage

Papilla, also known as pigmented appendages, are specialized structures found on the surface of mushrooms and other fungi. These structures play an important role in the identification and classification of fungi, as they can be used to differentiate between species and detect variation within a species. In mycology, Papilla are commonly used to determine the phylogeny of certain fungi, as they can be used to compare genetic or morphological characteristics between different species. Additionally, they are used to study the effects of environmental conditions on species, as the color and shape of the Papilla can change under different conditions. Thus, Papilla are essential for studying the diversity and ecology of mushrooms and other fungi in research.

# Example

Papilla is a traditional technique used in mycology to study fungal biology and the cultivation of edible mushrooms. By inoculating a substrate, such as wood chips or sawdust, with a mycelium culture, then incubating the substrate in a moist, dark environment, a nutrient-rich material suitable for mushroom fruiting can be produced. This material, referred to as a "Papilla", is rich in nutrients and provides an ideal substrate for mushroom cultivation, making it a valuable tool in the study and consumption of edible mushrooms.
