# Definition
    
    Saxicolous is a type of fungus that is adapted to live on rocks, stones, and other stony surfaces in a range of different environments.
    
    # Significance to Mycology
    
    Saxicolous fungi are important for mycological study as they represent some of the most adaptable and resilient species within the fungal kingdom. Their ability to survive under extreme environmental conditions makes them ideal for research into the biology, genetics, and physiology of fungi in general. Additionally, some species of saxicolous fungi are used for biomedical research and for the production of drugs and therapeutic agents.

# Usage

Saxicolous is an important term used to describe fungi that grow on rocks and other exposed non-soil surfaces. In mycology, this label is used to differentiate between fungi that are associated with mineral-rich surfaces and those that rely on soil-based substrates. Saxicolous fungi are typically adapted to such harsher environments and this adaptation often shapes the unique characteristics of the species. As such, the study of Saxicolous fungi is important in understanding the biology of fungi, their habitats, and their role in ecosystems. Furthermore, Saxicolous fungi serve as important bioindicators, useful in ecological and environmental studies.

# Example

Saxicolous is a term used to refer to organisms that grow on rocks or soil near rocks. As such, mycologists frequently use this term to refer to fungi and mushrooms that grow on or near rocks and stones. For instance, the popular culinary mushroom, chanterelle (Cantharellus cibarius), is a saprobic saxicolous species found in many countries around the world and commonly collected in forests. Similarly, the delicious morel (Morchella spp.), another popular edible mushroom, is also a saprobic saxicolous species. In both cases, mycologists rely on the term "saxicolous" to accurately describe the habitat of these fungi. Furthermore, Saxicolous is also used to classify and research fungi in agricultural settings, such as the cultivation of oyster mushrooms (Pleurotus ostreatus) on rocks and stones.
