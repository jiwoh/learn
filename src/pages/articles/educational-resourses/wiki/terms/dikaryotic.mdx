# Definition
    
    Dikaryotic is a term pertaining to a type of cell belonging to the group of fungus known as eukaryotes. In a dikaryotic cell, two separate haploid nuclei exist in the same cytoplasm, and both are required for sexual reproduction.
    
    # Significance 
    
    The significance of dikaryotic cells in mycology is that they form the basis of the species of fungi known as basidiomycetes. Most of the mushrooms, puffballs, shelf fungi, and bracket fungi that are collected and eaten by humans are basidiomycetes and contain dikaryotic cells. The ability of dikaryotic cells to reproduce sexually is important for the genetic diversity of these fungi, as well as the propagation of these species. Furthermore, the dikaryotic form of the cells is thought to be more advantageous over the haploid form in terms of growth, competitive ability, and stress resistance.

# Usage

Dikaryotic cells are highly advantageous for use in research and practical applications in mycology. Dikaryotic cells are often used in the study of different genetic processes, such as genetic recombination, gene regulation, and cell differentiation. Additionally, dikaryotic cells are used in the production of secondary metabolites, many of which are used in medical treatments and products. Finally, dikaryotic cells are also used in genetic engineering, allowing scientists to create organisms with desired genetic traits. Thus, dikaryotic cells are essential in mycology research, as they can help to create more advanced and beneficial results.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;A dikaryotic fungal strain is often used in the cultivation of mushrooms and other edible fungi. For example, the strain Agaricus bisporus is a dikaryotic variant of the white button mushroom and is considered one of the most widely cultivated mushroom species. Due to its dikaryotic nature, this strain is highly uniform and yields consistent, high-quality mushrooms. Further, its dikaryotic nature makes it amenable to modern breeding and biotechnological applications, such as genetic modification.&lt;/p&gt;
