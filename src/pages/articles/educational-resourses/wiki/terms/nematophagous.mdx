# Definition
    
    Nematophagous is an organism that utilizes nematodes (roundworms) as a food source. 
    
    # Significance
    
    Nematophagous fungi are one of the most important factors in regulating nematode populations in soil ecosystems. By preying on nematodes, these fungi help to maintain nematode population densities and prevent an overpopulation of nematodes, which can have a negative effect on other organisms in the soil. Many nematophagous fungi have been studied and have been found to have significant antimicrobial properties, making them of interest to many researchers in the fields of mycology, parasitology, and ecology.

# Usage

Nematophagous fungi have been identified to have potential applications in the biocontrol of plant-parasitic nematodes. These mycoparasites have the ability to parasitize the body wall of nematodes and reduce the numbers of parasites that are present in soil. In addition, they can produce secondary metabolites that can act as nematicides, further increasing their potential for biocontrol. As a result, research has been conducted to investigate the efficacy of nematophagous fungi in suppressing the abundance of plant-parasitic nematodes. This research has also revealed that certain species of nematophagous fungi can be selected for based on their compatibility with specific crops, allowing for better control of parasitic nematodes. Thus, the use of nematophagous fungi has become increasingly popular in sustainable pest management strategies, with potential applications in the agricultural and horticultural industries.

# Example

Nematophagous fungi are widely used to study the interactions between pathogenic nematodes and their hosts, such as plants and animals. These fungi are capable of entrapping nematodes inside structures called trapping devices and then secreting enzymes to digest the nematodes. This process has been widely used to study the behavior of parasitic nematodes, such as Meloidogyne incognita, as they attempt to infect their host. In addition, the application of Nematophagous fungi in soil can help suppress the growth of parasitic nematodes, thereby reducing losses due to parasitism. As such, Nematophagous fungi play an important role in the cultivation and consumption of mushrooms and other fungi.
