# Definition
    
    Lignicolous is an adjective used to describe fungi that are parasitic or symbiotic and grow on wood.
    
    ## Significance
    
    The lignicolous fungi play an important role in the cycling of nutrients and energy in the environment and are important to the ecology of various ecosystems. Lignicolous fungi are also important sources of new and useful medicinal products, such as antibiotics and anti-cancer drugs. Additionally, certain lignicolous fungi have been used to produce biofuels, as well as other industrial products.

# Usage

Lignicolous fungi are an integral part of mycology, with many practical applications. Mycologists often utilize lignicolous fungi to study the decay processes of wood, as well as to gain more information concerning fungal communities and species in forested ecosystems. With the use of lignicolous fungi, mycologists are also able to better understand how they interact with and influence the tree species with which they grow. Additionally, lignicolous fungi are essential to the process of wood decomposition, which plays a key role in aiding nutrient cycling and turnover in the environment. In short, lignicolous fungi are a crucial resource for mycologists, providing valuable insights and data for numerous important research topics.

# Example

Lignicolous fungi are widely studied for their role in the decomposition of woody substrates. For example, species belonging to the Basidiomycetes Phylum (e.g. Agaricus, Boletus, Russula, and Laccaria genera) are commonly found in the mycological community as lignicolous saprotrophs due to their ability to degrade woody substrates. This metabolic activity is important in the maintenance of forest ecosystems. Additionally, lignicolous fungi can be used in the professional cultivation of mushrooms and other fungi, as well as their consumption as a food source.
