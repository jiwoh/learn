# Definition
    
    Cystidium is a genus of filamentous fungi belonging to the hyphomycetes class. It is characterized by the presence of highly ornamented and thick-walled arthrospores called cystidia.
    
    # Significance 
    
    Cystidium is an important genus for mycology, as it is commonly used for the identification of species and genera of fungi. It is also used to differentiate between pathogenic and non-pathogenic fungi. The presence of cystidia serves as a good indicator of taxonomic relationships between filamentous fungi. Additionally, cystidia are important for the classification of fungi in the hyphomycetes class.

# Usage

Cystidium is widely used in mycology research to identify and recognize a wide range of fungi. Specifically, researchers use it to recognize the size and shape of cystidia, the hyphal branch systems of fungi, which provides them with valuable insights into the structure and phylogeny of specific species of fungi. Furthermore, cystidium can be used to distinguish between species of fungi which have indistinguishable macroscopic characteristics, allowing researchers to unlock the secrets of a species that may have previously been undistinguishable. Lastly, cystidium observation is used in conjunction with other microscopy techniques to gain a more accurate and unique understanding of the species being studied.

# Example

Cystidium is an important tool for studying a range of fungi, mushrooms, and their cultivation. Cystidium can be used to identify and classify fungi, measure the size and shape of mushroom cells, and detect toxic substances in mushrooms that may be poisonous to humans. Furthermore, it can be employed to identify fungi in culture collections to determine their taxonomic relationships and to identify fungal species in food samples. Additionally, Cystidium can be used to visualize the spores and hyphae of different species of fungi, which can aid in their species identification. Therefore, Cystidium can be a powerful tool in assisting mycologists in studying, cultivating, and consuming fungi.
