# Definition 
    
    Crustose is a form of lichen growth habit where the lichen thallus is closely appressed to the substrate surface in the form of a thin, crust-like areolate thallus.
    
    # Significance
    
    Crustose lichens are one of the three major growth forms observed for lichens, the other two being foliose and fruticose. Crustose lichens are particularly important for the landscape, soil and air quality due to their ability to rapidly colonize surfaces in harsh environments. Additionally, crustose lichens are important for the medicinal properties and cosmetics industries as they contain a variety of compounds with pharmaceutical applications.

# Usage

Crustose is an important lichen organism used in mycological research. It has many practical applications, such as being used as a bioindicator for environment monitoring, as well as being a tool for detecting toxins in the environment. Crustose is especially useful in studies of atmospheric pollution, soil contamination, and the detection of waterborne diseases. Additionally, the presence of Crustose species can indicate the presence of other organisms, including fungi and algae. Its presence is also an important indicator of the quality of the environment, as it responds to changes in acidity, nutrient availability, and air pollution. The use of Crustose in mycological research has made it possible to monitor the quality of the environment over time and helps to predict the effects of anthropogenic activities on ecologies.

# Example

Crustose is widely used in mycology as a tool for studying the growth of fungi and mushrooms. As a method of fungal cultivation, the Crustose technique involves containing the fungus' growth substrate in a shallow dish or container, with the substrate comprising of a mixture of sawdust and wheat bran. Once the substrate has been inoculated with fungal spores, the lid of the container is sealed, forming a humid and enclosed atmosphere necessary for the spores to germinate and form mycelium. The mycelium is then allowed to grow and spread over the surface of the substrate, forming a crust that is ultimately harvested for consumption.
