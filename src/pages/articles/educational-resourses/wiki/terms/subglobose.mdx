# Definition
    
    Subglobose, also known as subgloboseform, is a type of spore in mycology that is subglobular, or broadly ellipsoid in shape.
    
    # Significance
    
    Subglobose is a morphological descriptor used to identify the shape of a spore in mycology. Identifying the shape of a spore is important for understanding the taxonomic identity of a fungus. By classifying and categorizing spores based on their shape, mycologists can better understand the relationships between different species. Additionally, shape is a useful characteristic for distinguishing between species in related genera. The morphological characteristics of a spore can also provide important clues about environmental and ecological context.

# Usage

Subglobose is a term used in mycology to describe the shape of a mushroom, as well as other types of fungi. Subglobose mushrooms have a globose shape that is slightly flattened on the top, giving them a more flattened appearance than a perfectly round shape. Subglobose mushrooms are useful for identifying and classifying different species, as their unique shape is often a distinguishing feature among different groups. In research, this shape can be used to compare and contrast different types of fungi, or to establish relationships between different species. Additionally, the size and variation of the shape can be used in combination with other descriptive terms to better define and differentiate the species.

# Example

Subglobose is an important term in the study, cultivation, and consumption of fungi and mushrooms. It is used to refer to a particular shape of fruiting body, which is generally round and slightly flattened at the top and bottom. This shape is commonly seen among several species of mushrooms, most notably Agaricus Brunnescens and Morchella Esculenta. Many of the cultivation methods employed in mushroom production exploit the Subglobose shape by encouraging and promoting the formation of this particular type of fruiting body. Additionally, the shape can be used to differentiate between edible and poisonous mushrooms, as some edible species are often mistakenly identified as toxic due to their similar shape.
