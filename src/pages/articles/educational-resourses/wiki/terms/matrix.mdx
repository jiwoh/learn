# Definition
    
    Matrix is a term used in mycology to refer to the total organic matter of an environment that serves as a substantial source of energy, nutrition, and other substrates to support mycelial growth and the development of mycelial networks.
    
    # Significance
    
    Matrix is an important factor for mycologists to consider when studying mycelial networks, since it plays a vital role in providing the necessary energy and nutrients to support their growth and development. The availability and quality of matrix is intricately linked to the success of mycelial networks in any given environment. Matrix can also be used to analyze the effects of environmental disturbances on mycelial networks, allowing for a better understanding of their response to stressors.

# Usage

Matrix is a powerful tool for the analysis of fungal biodiversity. It has been used extensively for studies of fungal taxonomy and phylogeny, for example, to uncover evolutionary relationships between fungi and their environmental habitats. Matrix is also commonly used to detect differences in genetic diversity among fungi and their closest relatives, as well as tracing lineage and habitat associations of diverse fungal species. Matrix has been hugely useful in gathering evidence for the possible emergence of new species, and in understanding the evolutionary and ecological roles of fungi in global ecosystems. In addition, Matrix has been employed to identify overlooked fungal species and to assess the potential impacts of climate change on fungal diversity. Finally, Matrix is increasingly being utilized to assess the impacts of human activities on fungal relationships in different habitat types.

# Example

Matrix is widely used to study the composition of wild and cultivated mushrooms. Mycologists use Matrix to analyze the chemical makeup of various species of mushrooms, including their proteins, lipids, carbohydrates, and other metabolites. This information can be used to compare mushroom varieties, determine their potential uses and health benefits, and guide their cultivation and consumption. Additionally, Matrix is used to investigate the diversity of fungi within a given habitat, as well as how climate change and other environmental factors affect the abundance of certain mushroom species.
