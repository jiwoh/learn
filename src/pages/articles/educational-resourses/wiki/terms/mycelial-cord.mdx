## Definition
    
    Mycelial cord is an elongated formation formed by a single organism and composed of joined hyphae. The cord is the result of hyphae grouping together in a linear shape, and is typically visible to the naked eye.
    
    ## Significance
    
    Mycelial cords are important to mycology because they form the structure of certain fungal organisms, and help to spread spores, facilitate nutrient absorption, and enable the production of reproductive bodies. Mycelial cords are also an essential part of the mycological life cycle, helping to spread genetic material from one organism to another.

# Usage

Mycelial cord is an important tool in mycology research, as it enables the study of fungal organisms through the identification and analysis of their mycelial cords. Mycelial cords are defined as long, branching threads composed of mycelia (the vegetative fungi) that enable fungi to grow and thrive in the environment. Mycelial cords provide a direct view into the complex anatomy of fungi and allow for an understanding of their physiological activity and interactions with other organisms. Mycelial cord studies are used to identify fungal species, develop new biotechnologies, and establish control strategies for fungal pathogens. In addition, mycelial cord studies can help determine the symbiotic relationships between fungi and other organisms, allowing for the identification of important microbial interactions in the environment.

# Example

Mycelial cord is widely used to study mushrooms and their cultivation, as well as to determine their edibility for consumption. Mycelial cords derived from the same mushroom species can be used to isolate and transfer the genetic material of said species, thereby producing a clone of the original mushroom, known as a "monokaryotic mycelium". This process, which is also known as vegetative mycelial propagation, can be used to produce a higher quantity and quality of mushroom fruit bodies, as well as to isolate and create new strains of edible mushroom species.
