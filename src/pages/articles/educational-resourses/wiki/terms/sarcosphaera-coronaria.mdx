# Sarcosphaera coronaria 
    
    Sarcosphaera coronaria, commonly known as the blue star coral fungus, is a species of ascomycete fungus belonging to the family Sarcosomataceae. It is characterized by a bright blue, star-shaped fruiting body which is typically a few centimeters in diameter. It is generally found growing on dead deciduous trees, mainly beech and oak, and is widely distributed throughout the Northern Hemisphere.
    
    ## Significance to Mycology
    
    Sarcosphaera coronaria is an important species to mycologists because of its obligate saprotrophy lifestyle, meaning it mainly obtains nutrition by breaking down and consuming dead organic matter. It is also an important species to study due to its unique morphological characteristics, such as the bright blue, star-shaped fruiting body. Additionally, Sarcosphaera coronaria has been found to produce a variety of secondary metabolites, including norcarane, norlorsonic acid and cynodiol, which have been used in pharmaceutical and medical research.

# Usage

&lt;p&gt;Sarcosphaera coronaria is a species of fungus highly valued by mycologists due to its significance in research. This species is commonly used to help identify the phylogenetic relationships of other fungal species, and as a standard species in phylogenetic studies. Its phylogenetic consistency and its high reproduction rate make it an ideal organism for this purpose. Sarcosphaera coronaria has also been used to help understand the evolution of fungal diseases, with several studies examining the changes in disease susceptibility over evolutionary time. Additionally, this species is an important source of bioactive compounds, being a rich source of flavonoids, terpenoids, and polysaccharides, which can be used in various medicinal applications. All these uses of Sarcosphaera coronaria contribute to the advancement of mycology research and help increase our understanding of the evolution and biology of fungal species.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;Sarcosphaera coronaria is widely used in the cultivation and study of mushrooms. Specifically, it is used to assess the impact of varying environmental conditions on the growth and development of mushroom mycelia. In a study published in Applied Microbiology and Biotechnology, researchers used S. coronaria to analyze how different temperatures and soil types impact the biomass production of Pleurotus ostreatus, a type of edible mushroom. They found that the highest biomass production occurred at a temperature of 27Â°C and in the soil with the highest organic matter content. This research highlights the usefulness of S. coronaria in cultivating mushrooms and demonstrates its potential for informing the design of optimized cultivation systems.&lt;/p&gt;
