# Definition
    
    **Stellate** is an adjective used to describe fungi with a star-like, or radiating, growth pattern. 
    
    # Significance
    
    Stellate patterns are indicative of certain types of fungi, such as the Ascomycota, and can be useful for classifying and identifying different species. Fungi with stellate growth patterns often have complex and intertwined forms, providing a unique and visually interesting way to categorize them. Additionally, since the pattern of the fungus is distinct, it can help to accurately identify the species.

# Usage

Stellate is a highly useful tool in conducting mycological research. The software allows researchers to quickly and accurately determine the taxonomic identity of fungi, as well as gain valuable insight into diverse populations of fungi. For example, Stellate can generate a phylogenetic tree for a group of fungi, which can be used to identify closely related species and elucidate evolutionary relationships. Additionally, Stellate can calculate the genetic diversity between individuals of a species and rapidly estimate a species' geographic range. The software's speed and versatility make it a valuable tool for mycologists interested in furthering their understanding of macrofungal ecology.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;Stellate is a widely used tool in the study of fungi, mushrooms, and their cultivation and consumption. For example, researchers have employed Stellate to assess the efficacy of various cultivation techniques on the growth and development of a common Basidiomycete mushroom, &lt;i&gt;Agaricus bisporus&lt;/i&gt;. By combining the traditional methods of mycological culturing with Stellate's ability to collect detailed environmental data, the researchers were able to determine the optimal temperatures and light levels for successful mushroom cultivation. Additionally, Stellate was used to monitor the quality of the mushrooms, assessing their size, shape, color, and spore production.&lt;/p&gt;
