# Definition
    
    In mycology, Glabrous is a term used to describe the surface of fungal fruiting bodies that lack any type of adornment, such as hairs, scales, or other appendages. Fungi with a glabrous surface appear smooth to the naked eye, and are often referred to as glabrous mushrooms.
    
    # Significance
    
    The term “glabrous” is important in mycology as it helps to distinguish one fungus from another. Many species of mushrooms are glabrous and can only be identified by their distinct morphology. Additionally, glabrous mushrooms are often easier to handle than their hairy counterparts and therefore may be preferred in certain mushroom dishes. Finally, glabrous mushrooms often provide a better substrate for certain mycological studies, as the lack of hair or scales provides a clean and unobstructed surface for observation.

# Usage

Glabrous is used widely in mycology to describe the surface of fungi. It is used to describe the absence of any pubescence or any other type of surface covering of fungi. This is important in research because fungi can have distinct morphologies that can influence their identification and ability to interact with certain environments. Knowing the presence or absence of a pubescence on a fungus can help mycologists understand its potential interactions and identify it correctly. Additionally, the presence of glabrous surfaces can create further insight into the study of fungal ecology and the role of surface morphology in their evolution.

# Example

Glabrous is widely used by mycologists to study certain types of mushrooms and fungi in a variety of environmental settings. Glabrous has been used to examine the spore-bearing structures, mycelia patterns, and fruiting body features of fungi in order to identify unknown species. It has also been used to study the morphological characteristics of fungus species for taxonomic classifications, as well as to analyze fungal diversity, survival, and propagation in different environments. Glabrous has been used to study the environmental and anthropogenic influences on fungal ecology, as well as the relevance of fungi to human consumption, such as in the development of novel mushroom products.
