# Guttule
    
    Guttule is a type of fungal cell wall morphology. Specifically, it is a type of septal wall, which is the region of the fungal cell wall that separates adjacent compartments or cells. The word "guttule" is derived from the Latin word for "little drops," as the wall structure is characterized by the formation of small, circular septa or "guttules."
    
    ## Significance of Guttule to Mycology
    
    Guttule is important in mycology due to its role in the structure and function of fungal cell walls. It is believed that the presence of guttule helps to maintain the integrity of the fungal cell wall, which helps to protect the cell from environmental stressors and damage. Guttule also plays a role in the exchange of materials between cells, as the presence of septa aids in the transportation of nutrients across the fungal cell wall. Additionally, the presence of guttule can be used to identify certain types of fungi; for example, the presence of guttule has been used to distinguish between certain types of Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes.

# Usage

Guttule is a powerful tool that is used in mycology research to identify unique fungal species. It is used to compare and contrast the DNA sequence of two different species of fungi, enabling researchers to identify potential differences in their genetic makeup. This is particularly useful when comparing phylogenetically related species, as a comparison of their Guttule sequence can provide important information regarding their evolutionary history. Additionally, Guttule can be used to differentiate between closely related species and even distinguish between genera. The ability to accurately identify species can be beneficial for disease prevention and management, as well as for the development of new treatments and therapies.

# Example

Guttule is a diagnostic tool widely utilized in the study, cultivation, and consumption of fungi, mushrooms, and other organisms within the kingdom Fungi. Specifically, Guttule can be used to study the morphology of a particular species. For example, one can use Guttule to identify morphological differences between two closely-related species of mushroom, such as the pholiota squarrosa and the pholiota squarrosoides, by examining the shapes and sizes of their spines, gills, and other features. Additionally, the information gained from the morphological analysis of Guttule can be used to inform decisions like which species of mushroom to cultivate or which mushrooms are safe to eat.
