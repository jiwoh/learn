# Definition
    
    Noble rot is a type of fungus, Botrytis cinerea, which is found on grape skins and is responsible for the development of sweet and concentrated wines. 
    
    # Significance
    
    Noble rot is an important part of wine production, as the fungus hastens the rate of evaporation in the grape, resulting in the development of a sweeter wine. The presence of Botrytis cinerea, when the fruits are ripe, is essential for the production of many sweet wines, such as ice wines, Sauternes, Monbazillac, Tokaji, and vin de paille. It is also important for dry wines as it produces subtle flavors and increases complexity. Botrytis cinerea can also increase antioxidant levels in the wine, improving its stability.

# Usage

&lt;p&gt;Noble rot, or &lt;i&gt;Botrytis cinerea&lt;/i&gt;, is a ubiquitous fungal pathogen with significant practical applications in mycology. It is commonly used in viticulture to produce dessert wines such as Sauternes and Tokaji, as it causes a form of grape rot known as "pourriture noble" or "noble rot". In addition, it is used in mycological research as the primary source of genetic mutations in a variety of organisms. In particular, the effects of &lt;i&gt;Botrytis cinerea&lt;/i&gt; on plant gene expression provide a valuable model for understanding how plant species respond to and tolerate fungal pathogens. Furthermore, its unique ability to affect a variety of plant species is used to study fundamental questions such as the molecular basis of host-pathogen interactions and the evolution of resistance and susceptibility.

# Example

Noble rot is widely utilized as an effective method for studying the cultivation and consumption of mushrooms. By exposing these organisms to a low relative humidity, which accompanied by a high atmospheric moisture content, sporulation can be induced in many species. This process, otherwise known as anhydrobiosis, allows the further study of mushroomsâ€™ microbiology, physiology, and ecology. In addition, Noble rot exposure has been used to study the effects of temperature, light, and airborne contaminants on mushroom species.
