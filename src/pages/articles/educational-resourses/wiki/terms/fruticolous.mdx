## Definition
    Fruticolous refers to forms of mycorrhizal fungi that form a mutual relationship with the roots of woody plants. The relationship between the fungus and the plant provides mutual benefit for both, with the fungus receiving nutrients from the plant and the plant receiving water and mineral nutrition from the fungus. The relationship is generally permanent and lasting.
    
    ## Significance
    Fruticolous mycorrhizal fungi are essential for the healthy growth and development of woody plants, such as trees, shrubs, and vines. The fungus helps the plant to access and absorb more nutrients and water than it could on its own, improving growth and allowing the plant to thrive in a wide range of environmental conditions. This type of mycorrhizal fungi is also important in promoting the uptake of essential nutrients, such as phosphorus and nitrogen, which are often limiting in soils.

# Usage

&lt;p&gt;Fruticolous is an essential tool for mycologists, as it allows us to accurately identify and classify different species of fungi. With Fruticolous, we can accurately assess the morphology, size, shape, color, and texture of a fungus in order to properly identify it. This information is then used to determine the species of the fungus and classify it into a particular genus. As an added benefit, Fruticolous can also be used to detect potential infectious agents in a fungus, allowing us to determine if it is a pathogenic species or not. All of this information is invaluable in helping us understand the diversity and ecology of fungi, as well as providing us with reliable data for our research.

# Example

Fruticolous is a widely used method for the study of fungi, mushrooms, and mycology. It involves the cultivation of fungi on decaying woody substrates such as fallen branches, logs, and stumps, where the fungi can obtain their nutrient needs. This method is advantageous because the presence of the organic matter allows the fungi to obtain essential nutrients, while also avoiding competition with other fungi. Fruticolous fungi can be studied directly in situ, or can be isolated, cultivated, and identified in the lab. The resulting cultures can then be used to analyze the genetic structure, morphology, and ecology of the fungi. Furthermore, this method has been used to cultivate edible mushrooms, such as shiitake and oyster mushrooms, as well as medicinal or intoxicating mushrooms, such as psilocybin mushrooms.
