# Pathogenic Fungi in Humans
    
    Pathogenic fungi are microorganisms that can cause disease in humans. These fungi can infect humans directly or through contact with infected surfaces or items. Pathogenic fungi typically have specialized properties and behaviors which allow them to cause illness when tissues and organs are exposed to them. These fungi can also be spread through inhalation or ingestion of their spores, or by direct contact with infected material. Pathogenic fungi are a significant concern in mycology, as they can cause fatal and debilitating illnesses if left untreated.

# Usage

Pathogenic fungi in humans are used in many areas of mycology research. For example, they can be studied to determine the environmental triggers and mechanisms of infection, the impacts of different pathogenic fungi on host tissues, and the development of novel treatments and preventive measures. Pathogenic fungi in humans can also be used to evaluate the efficacy of existing treatment protocols for various infections. Additionally, pathogenic fungi are essential to understanding the complex molecular mechanisms of fungal-host interactions. Finally, pathogenic fungi are valuable tools for understanding the epidemiology of fungal diseases and developing strategies for managing outbreaks.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;As an example of how pathogenic fungi in humans is used to study fungus, mushrooms, or in their cultivation or consumption, the most prominent example is the study of mycotoxins, which are toxic compounds produced by certain species of fungi that can cause illness in humans. Several species of fungi are capable of producing mycotoxins, such as Aspergillus, Penicillium, Fusarium and Claviceps. The presence of these toxic compounds in food and feed can cause a variety of health problems including immune suppression, neurological impairment, respiratory illness and cancer. As a result, the detection and measurement of mycotoxins is an important component of food and feed safety programs. Additionally, studies of pathogenic fungi in humans are being conducted to understand the mechanisms by which various species cause disease in order to develop methods for prevention and treatment.&lt;/p&gt;
