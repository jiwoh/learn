## Definition
    
    Disseminated candidiasis is an opportunistic fungal infection caused by the yeast species Candida. It occurs when the yeast travels through the bloodstream, resulting in colonization of organs and other tissues.
    
    ## Significance to Mycology
    
    Disseminated candidiasis is an important issue in mycology, as it can be life-threatening if not treated early and correctly. The infection can occur in immunocompromised people, including those with HIV/AIDS and cancer, making it a dangerous and widespread infection. As a result, it is important that mycologists understand the risk factors, symptoms, and treatments for the infection in order to properly diagnose and treat it.

# Usage

&lt;p&gt;Disseminated candidiasis is a serious infection caused by the fungus Candida, largely affecting immunocompromised individuals. It is one of the leading causes of mortality due to fungally-induced infections. Mycologists use Disseminated candidiasis to study the virulence and pathogenesis of Candida due to their ability to cause severe, systemic infections in humans. Such studies have sheds light on the importance of novel therapeutic approaches and improved diagnosis of this infection. Additionally, Disseminated candidiasis can be used to evaluate antifungal drug efficacy, allowing for the identification and development of new antifungal agents to treat this lethal infection. &lt;/p&gt;

# Example

&lt;p&gt;Disseminated candidiasis is a form of systemic candidiasis which can cause infection of the internal organs, skin, and other body systems. It is a common cause of mortality in immunocompromised individuals and is frequently studied in the laboratory setting to understand the growth and spread of the fungus associated with this condition. For example, researchers have used a series of laboratory experiments to study the effect of various environmental conditions on the growth and spread of Candida albicans, the most common cause of this condition. The study of Disseminated candidiasis provides important insight into the biology of fungi and how they interact with their environment, including the effects of temperature, nutrients, and antifungal treatments on the growth and spread of the fungus.&lt;/p&gt;
