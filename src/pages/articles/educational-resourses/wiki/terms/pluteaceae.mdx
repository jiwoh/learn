The Pluteaceae family is a group of gilled mushrooms typically found in the Agaricales order of the Basidiomycota phylum. It is composed of various genera including Pluteus, Volvopluteus, and Chroogomphus, among others.
    
    ## Significance of Pluteaceae
    
    The Pluteaceae family is important to mycology due to its relationship to the cultivation of edible mushrooms. Several species, such as Volvopluteus gloiovolvatus and Pluteus cyanopus, have been collected for culinary purposes or have been used as a health supplement. Other species, such as Chroogomphus tomentosus, have been studied for their therapeutic properties. Additionally, due to their easily identifiable features and wide distribution, Pluteaceae species are frequently used as a model organism for research studies.

# Usage

Pluteaceae are important in mycology due to their role as saprobic fungi. As saprobic fungi, members of this family are able to utilize a variety of organic substrates, such as wood and other plant matter, for their energy and nutrition. As a result, they are important decomposers in the eco-system. Pluteaceae are also used to assess the health of a soil or environment based on the presence or abundance of certain species of this family. Furthermore, Pluteaceae are frequently targeted in mycological research studies in order to gain insight into the dynamics of a certain habitat, or to assess succession or speciation of saprobic fungi.

# Example

Pluteaceae is a family of fungi belonging to the order Agaricales. It is widely studied for its large number of edible and medicinal species, such as shiitake, oyster and enoki mushrooms, which are widely consumed in many cultures. The family is also known for its wide range of morphological, physiological and ecological characteristics, which make it an important model for research in fungal ecology and genome-scale phylogenetics. Furthermore, Pluteaceae has been used in the development of cultivation techniques, such as biopesticides to control plant pests and fertilizer amendments to enhance soil fertility. Finally, Pluteaceae has also been used in bioremediation, as fungi from this family are capable of breaking down hydrocarbons and other pollutants, making them important agents in the mitigation of environmental contamination.
