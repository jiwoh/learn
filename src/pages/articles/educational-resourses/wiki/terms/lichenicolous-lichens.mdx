# Lichenicolous Lichens
    
    Lichenicolous lichens are lichens that are associated with and grow on other lichens. They represent a unique group of organisms in the mycology field as the majority of lichens form mutually beneficial symbiotic relationships with fungi and algae. Lichenicolous lichens, in contrast, are parasitic in nature, with many of them producing specialized structures to facilitate their parasitic behavior.
    
    ## Significance of Lichenicolous Lichens in Mycology
    
    Lichenicolous lichens are of great importance to the field of mycology due to their unique characteristics. Their parasitic nature gives researchers insight into the evolutionary origin of the parasitic trait and its ability to spread, while their ecological role in the lichen community has been used to develop new models of community dynamics. Additionally, their growth patterns provide insight into the physiology and biochemistry of both the lichenicolous lichens and their hosts.

# Usage

Lichenicolous lichens are an important tool in mycology research and in practical applications. They are used to identify and classify other lichens, particularly in areas where other lichens are scarce or difficult to identify. By observing the lichenicolous lichen, the researcher can determine the genus and species of the host lichen and record ecological information. This data provides an insight into the host lichen's life history, ecology, and distribution. In addition, lichenicolous lichens can be used to detect the presence of pollutants in the environment, as certain species are sensitive to air pollutants. As a result, lichenicolous lichens provide valuable insights into the health of an area and the ecosystems here.

# Example

Lichenicolous lichens are widely used in the study of fungi, mushrooms, and their cultivation and consumption. For example, a recent study used lichenicolous lichens to monitor the effects of anthropogenic disturbances on mycorrhizal fungi in temperate forest soils. The study found that lichenicolous lichen species were useful indicator species for monitoring mycorrhizal fungi under different environmental conditions, providing insight into the effects of human activities on the mycorrhizal fungi communities. This research supports the need for further research into the impact of anthropogenic disturbances on lichenicolous lichens and their associated fungi.
