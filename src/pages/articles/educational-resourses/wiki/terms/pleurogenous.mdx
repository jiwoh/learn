# Definition
    
    Pleurogenous is a term used to refer to any species of a mushroom or fungus that has a pleurocarpous growth habit, meaning the mushrooms grow in a layer or sheet from the side of the substrate.
    
    # Significance 
    
    Pleurogenous mushrooms are a significant class of fungi with many economically important species, including edible mushrooms such as chanterelles, shiitake, and oyster mushrooms, as well as many species of toxic or medicinal mushrooms, such as the amanita muscaria. Furthermore, many species of pleurogenous fungi are important decomposers and recyclers of nutrients in their ecosystems, playing an essential role in the health of the forests they inhabit.

# Usage

&lt;p&gt;Pleurogenous is used in mycology to describe the pleurocarpous form of mushrooms, which is characterized by a gill-like layer of spore-bearing tissue that runs along the edge of the fruiting bodies. This form of mushroom is found in many edible mushrooms, such as shiitake, oyster mushroom, and porcini mushroom. The pleurocarpous form of fruiting bodies has been found to be a highly efficient method of spore dispersal, as the gills are well exposed to the environment for spore dissemination. Additionally, the pleurocarpous form of fruits is less vulnerable to being eaten by animals, as the edge of the fruit is less likely to be exposed. The pleurocarpous form of mushrooms has been significant in research, as this form of fruiting body is often studied to determine the optimal conditions for spore dispersal and the role of dispersal in the development of fungal ecosystems. &lt;/p&gt;

# Example

Pleurogenous is widely used as an identification marker for a variety of fungi species. For instance, the presence of Pleurogenous spores in a particular mushroom species can provide valuable insight into the taxonomy and evolutionary history of the particular mushroom. Additionally, Pleurogenous is often used to assess fungal contamination in soil, food, and other products, in order to ensure the safety of their consumption. Furthermore, Pleurogenous can be used by researchers to study the potential health benefits of mushrooms and/or other edible fungi.
