# Fairy Ring
    
    Fairy ring, also known as fairy circle, pixie ring, or elves circle, is a naturally occurring phenomenon in which a ring of mushrooms, toadstools, or other fungal growth appears in grassy areas such as lawns, pastures, and meadows. Fairy rings are caused by the underground growth of certain types of fungi, which can form a circle or arc of mushrooms or other forms of visible growth.
    
    ## Significance of Fairy Ring to Mycology
    
    Fairy rings are important to mycology for several reasons. They are an example of a naturally occurring phenomenon that demonstrates the wide range of fungi species’ ability to form complex structures and growth patterns. It is also an example of the fungi’s power to affect its environment. Fairy rings are a visible result of the fungi’s growth and activities, as it alters the soil composition, pH balance, and water availability in its surrounding area, affecting the grass and other vegetation growing there.

# Usage

Fairy rings are an important phenomenon of mycology that can be used to study the environmental and habitat conditions of fungi. Fairy rings form when a single mycelium spreads outward over a nutrient-rich area, causing a fungal growth. The mycelium produces fruiting bodies in concentric circles, forming a ring. These rings can serve as a visual indicator of the spread of the mycelium and its habitat preferences. By studying the structure and size of the fairy rings, it is possible to determine the age of the fungus, its growth trajectory, and the nutrient-richness of the surrounding area. Fairy rings have been used as indicators of land degradation, soil fertility, and land-use change. In addition, due to the longevity of fairy rings, they have been used to study the effects of climatic changes on the spread and development of fungi.

# Example

Fairy ring is a commonly used method for studying and cultivating fungi, mushrooms, and other organisms. This phenomenon is characterized by an initially circular pattern of growth caused by the radial expansion of mycelium. The concentric rings of mushrooms or other fruiting bodies are typical indicators of Fairy ring growth. As these rings expand, they can be used as a means of studying mycelia colonization and the conditions necessary for mushroom development. This method has been used to identify prime mushroom habitats, as well as for studying the ability of different fungi to resist environmental factors such as temperature, humidity, and water availability.
