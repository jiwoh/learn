## Definition
    
    Zoopagomycotina is a class within the phylum Glomeromycota, which includes a group of fungi that form mycorrhizal associations with plants. Zoopagomycotina is composed of two orders, Zoopagales and Glomerales, which contain several genera and species.
    
    ## Significance
    
    Zoopagomycotina fungi are important in the mycological study of plant-fungal mutualisms and mycorrhizal associations. These fungi are beneficial to plants as they increase the absorption of soil-up nutrients, reduce the impact of drought, and increase the resistance to soil pathogens and other environmental stresses. As a result, Zoopagomycotina fungi are commonly used in agriculture and forestry to promote plant growth.  Moreover, these fungi are important for the study of evolutionary relationships between plants and fungi, as well as for the development of mycorrhizal-based biotechnological applications.

# Usage

Zoopagomycotina is a subgroup in the kingdom of Fungi (Ascomycota), and has significant usage in mycology. The fungus in this group are important as biocontrol agents, as they can be used to combat various plant pathogens and aid in crop production. Additionally, this group of fungi are important model organisms for research on fungal chitinase and cellulase production, as well as their function and regulation. In addition, Zoopagomycotina species have been isolated from various thermophilic and extreme environments, providing insight into the evolution and adaptation of fungi to diverse environments. Therefore, Zoopagomycotina has an important role in both mycological research and practical applications.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;Zoopagomycotina has been widely used for fungus cultivation and consumption. The use of this phylum is particularly well established in ectomycorrhizal fungi, which are mutualistic associations between fungi and the roots of certain plants. Studies utilizing Zoopagomycotina have determined the possible mechanisms involved in this association, such as nutrients exchange from the fungus to the host plant and the potential transfer of mycorrhiza-soluble nutrients from the plant to the fungus. Furthermore, the use of Zoopagomycotina for the study of mushroom production has revealed insights into the ecology and physiology of different mushroom species. Additionally, the application of this phylum has also been used to assess the nutritional and medicinal properties of various mushroom species. &lt;/p&gt;
