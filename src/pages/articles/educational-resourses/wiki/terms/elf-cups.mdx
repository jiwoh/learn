# Definition of Elf Cups
    
    Elf cups, also known as Sarcoscypha coccinea, are a species of cup fungi in the family Sarcosomataceae. They are commonly found in forests, growing on decaying wood and other organic material. Elf cups appear as small saucer-shaped cups with a bright red to orange or yellow inner surface.
    
    # Significance to Mycology
    
    Elf cups are of particular interest to mycologists due to their distinctive appearance and interesting ecologic role. They can be the first indicators of decay in wood, and can be used to measure the rate of decomposition. Furthermore, they provide an excellent substrate for studying the effects of environmental changes on fungal communities. Additionally, they have been identified as potential sources of new drugs and industrial enzymes.

# Usage

Elf cups are an important tool for mycologists and can be utilized in both research and practical applications. The cups are formed from the reproductive structures of many species of basidiomycetes, such as Russulaceae and Boletaceae, and can be used to isolate and collect isolated spores, as well as examine spore morphology. Additionally, the size and shape of the cups can be used to identify species and can be used to perform spore germination experiments. Elf cups offer a convenient and cost-effective way of studying and collecting a variety of spore types, making them invaluable for research and practical applications.

# Example

Elf cups are widely used in mycology to study the biology, ecology, and phylogeny of fungi, mushrooms, and their relatives. For example, in sampling for cultural and molecular diversity, Elf cups are used to isolate and identify potential new species by their distinctive morphology and to assess the phylogenetic relationships between species through DNA-based analyses. In cultivation, Elf cups are used as a substrate for mushroom fruiting body formation, allowing growers to monitor the growth and development of their specimen of interest with ease and accuracy. Finally, they are frequently employed in the field to test mushroom edibility and to collect specimens for later identification in the laboratory.
