## Definition
    
    Cortina is the name given to a unique, cobweb-like webbing produced by certain species of fungi during their fruiting body stage. This webbing can appear white, grey, or brown and is composed of compactly tangled threads of fungal mycelium.
    
    ## Significance
    
    Cortina serves as a diagnostic tool for mycologists, helping to differentiate various species of fungi. Its presence can detect the presence of fungal diseases, such as the potato blight that affected Ireland in the 1840s. Cortina is also used to identify mycorrhizal fungi, which are beneficial fungi that form mutualistic partnerships with plant and tree roots. Ultimately, identifying Cortina can aid mycologists in properly managing and conserving fungi-rich ecosystems.

# Usage

Cortina is a powerful tool used in mycology for identifying and characterizing fungal species. It is typically used to detect fungal DNA sequences in environmental samples, and can be used to screen for the presence of fungal pathogens, as well as investigate their genetic diversity. Additionally, Cortina can be used to differentiate between fungal species, making it an invaluable tool for species identification. The data generated by Cortina can also be used to assess the composition and diversity of fungal communities in various habitats. In short, Cortina is an effective and efficient tool for mycologists, as it provides detailed molecular information on the abundance, diversity, and phylogeny of fungal species.

# Example

Cortina is widely used in mycology for studying the genetic composition of fungi, mushrooms, and their associated organisms. Genetic analysis can be used to understand the phylogeny of fungi, detect chemical compounds associated with the organisms, and identify novel species. Additionally, Cortina has been used to assess the genetic diversity of wild mushroom species, helping to guide the cultivation of fungi for food production purposes. For example, a study from 2019 used Cortina to assess the genetic diversity of 577 wild mushroom species collected from various locations in China, finding greater genetic diversity in regions with higher temperatures and higher average precipitation. The results of the study have been used to guide future mushroom cultivation efforts in the region.
