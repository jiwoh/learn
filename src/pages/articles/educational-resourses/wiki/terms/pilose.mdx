# Definition:
    
    Pilose is a type of mushroom or fungal fruiting body that lacks gills and instead has pores or tubes on the underside of the cap which are used for reproduction.
    
    # Significance: 
    
    Pilose is an important component of the mycologist's classification system, as it is often used to differentiate between different types of mushrooms. Pilose mushrooms are often desirable to the culinary world due to their unique flavor and texture. Additionally, they are also an important component of the local ecosystem, as they provide nutrients and energy to other organisms, such as bacteria and higher plants. Lastly, they are also important because they can provide insight into how different fungi species interact with each other in a given environment.

# Usage

Pilose is commonly used in mycology for the identification of fungal species. It is an important tool for accurately and consistently distinguishing between different species. Pilose allows mycologists to perform morphological comparisons between different fungi, which is essential in determining the identity of a species. In addition, Pilose allows for the precise examination of microscopic features and provides excellent resolution for the accurate analysis of spores and fruiting bodies. Further, Pilose can be used for the preparation of slide mounts for further microscopic analysis. These features make Pilose a valuable tool for researching and identifying unfamiliar fungi.

# Example

Pilose is frequently used in the study of fungi and mushrooms as a tool for molecular analysis. With the high phylogenetic resolution of the internal transcribed spacer regions, species-level identification can be accomplished for both cultivated and wild specimens. This has been especially useful for identifying commercially available edible and medicinal mushrooms, as well as for tracking the spread of fungal pathogens, both of which rely on accurate identification of species. Additionally, the Pilose technique has provided insight into the diversity of fungal species, allowing researchers to trace the evolution and dispersal of fungi, as well as to identify different subspecies with varied physiological and ecological characteristics.
