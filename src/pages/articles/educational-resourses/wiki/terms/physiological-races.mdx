# Definition
    
    Physiological races are populations of a species that differ in their physiological traits, such as growth rate or resistance to particular stresses.
    
    # Significance
    
    Physiological races play an important role in mycology, as they provide insights into the speciesâ€™ adaptability. Studying physiological races can lead to a better understanding of how a species may react to changes in its environment. Knowing which physiological traits are associated with particular races can help mycologists decide which races to cultivate in order to better meet the needs of various industries, such as food production and pharmaceuticals. Additionally, the identification of physiological races can offer insight into how species may evolve in the future, which can be crucial for predicting potential outbreaks of disease.

# Usage

Physiological races are essential for understanding the genetics of fungi and their evolutionary history. Physiological races are used to classify fungal species into different taxonomic groups based on differences in growth rate, temperature tolerance, and other phenotypic characters. By studying different physiological races, mycologists can uncover the genetic and environmental factors that create and maintain these phenotypic differences between species. Furthermore, physiological races provide a model for exploring the process of speciation and can help us to better understand how pathogens and opportunistic species can affect crop health, human health, and ecosystem dynamics.

# Example

Physiological races of fungi are widely used to study a variety of species, from mushrooms to yeasts. For example, different physiological races of the common edible mushroom Agaricus bisporus have been identified, each exhibiting different characteristics such as varying levels of resistance to certain environmental factors and diseases. These physiological races have been studied for their potential for mushroom cultivation and consumption, as certain races may be better adapted to particular conditions and produce increased yields. Furthermore, scientists have used physiological races to study the mechanisms of pathogenicity and to develop control strategies for plant diseases caused by fungi.
