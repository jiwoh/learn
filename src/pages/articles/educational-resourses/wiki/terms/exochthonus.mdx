# Definition
    
    Exochthonus is an anamorphic genus of filamentous fungi in the class Myxomycetes. It is believed to be composed of a single species, Exochthonus leiosporus, that is found in tropical and subtropical regions.
    
    # Significance
    
    Exochthonus is important to mycology as it is one of the few genera in the class Myxomycetes that includes anamorphic species. An anamorph is an asexual, or non-sexual, form of a fungus that can exist independently. By studying Exochthonus and other anamorphic fungal genera, mycologists gain better insight into the life cycles and reproduction of these organisms.

# Usage

Exochthonus is a valuable tool in mycology research, as it is capable of detecting and quantifying total fungal DNA in a variety of samples. The method employs selective inhibition of host genomic DNA, eliminating the need for sample purification prior to analysis. This ability significantly reduces the cost and effort required for fungal DNA extraction from complex samples. Additionally, Exochthonus can distinguish among different fungal groups and quantify both total fungal biomass and the presence of specific fungal species within a sample. This makes Exochthonus an invaluable tool for researchers studying fungal diversity, the dynamics of fungal populations, or the impacts of fungal diseases.

# Example

Exochthonus is widely used to study the cultivation and consumption of mushrooms, particularly edible species. Using molecular phylogenetics and molecular clock analysis, Exochthonus has been applied in studies to identify novel species and determine the evolutionary relationship between species. It has also been used to assess the genetic diversity of mushroom populations, which is important for a variety of objectives, including maintaining genetic diversity for conservation measures and improving the production of mushrooms through selective cultivation. In addition, Exochthonus can be used to provide information on the safety and nutritional profiles of edible mushrooms, which is important for the sustainable consumption of mushrooms.
