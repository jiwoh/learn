# Definition
    
    Multiseptate (adj.): A term used to describe a species of fungi that has multiple septa, or cross-walls, separating the compartments of the fungus.
    
    # Significance
    
    The presence of multiseptate cells is important in the classification of fungi. It is a key diagnostic feature in identifying species, as many fungi have specific characteristics that depend on the number and arrangement of septa. Additionally, multiseptate fungi can be used to study fungal evolution, as they are often the result of divergence between related species. Finally, multiseptate fungi are of particular interest to mycologists due to the unique ecology and physiology of these species.

# Usage

Multiseptate is a useful tool for mycologists in the study of fungi. It is used to identify and categorize a range of fungi, primarily those that are of a higher-level phylogenetic taxon such as species, genus, or family. Multiseptate is particularly important in the identification of fungi that have a number of different genera present within the same lineage; this is known as polyphyletic taxonomy. By analyzing the molecular sequences of these fungi, mycologists can better understand the relationship between them and their evolutionary history. Multiseptate can also be used in the field of mycology to aid in the identification of new species or to corroborate existing ones. Furthermore, it can be used to identify the presence of specific toxins in fungi, which is crucial information for both researchers and consumers. Ultimately, Multiseptate provides an invaluable tool for mycologists in the study of fungi.

# Example

Multiseptate is a widely used tool for the study of fungi, mushrooms, and their cultivation or consumption. This technique is particularly useful in the identification of polypores, bracket fungi, and other species within the fungal kingdom. Through the application of various staining methods, the multiseptate structure of these organisms can be observed, classified, and recorded. Moreover, these observations can be used to better understand the environmental factors that influence the growth and spread of mushrooms. Additionally, the presence of certain cellular components within the multiseptate structure can be used to indicate the edibility of a particular species. Through the application of Multiseptate, mushroom farmers and mycologists alike can gain valuable insight into the various species of fungi growing in their environment.
