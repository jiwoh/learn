# Definition
    
    Seminicolous is a term used to describe fungi that occur in the fruiting body or sporocarp near the surface of the soil.
    
    # Significance
    
    Seminicolous fungi are important to mycologists because they provide an insight into the ecology of the soil they inhabit. They are also important because they are used to identify certain taxonomic groups. For example, the presence or absence of seminicolous fungi can be used to distinguish between members of the Geoglossaceae and Helotiaceae families.

# Usage

Seminicolous is a specialized form of spore dispersal which is most commonly associated with the mycorrhizal fungi, which are the fungi that form symbiotic relationships with plant roots. In mycology, Seminicolous is used to refer to the process by which the fungi disperse a single spore through a small opening, typically an existing hole in the fruit or nut shell. This is a very efficient form of spore dispersal, since the spores are rapidly and uniformly spread among different areas. The importance of Seminicolous in mycology lies in its ability to increase the rate of spore dispersal, which means increased colonization and the establishment of mycorrhizal relationships. Additionally, the use of Seminicolous can help to ensure a successful mycorrhizal association between the fungi and the host plants.

# Example

Seminicolous is widely used in the study of fungi, mushrooms, and their cultivation. For example, it is used to identify and differentiate fungi species based on their spore print color, shape, and size. Further, it can be used to examine the physiological characteristics of fungal tissues to determine important nutrients, including proteins, lipids, and carbohydrates. Finally, it is used to analyze charcoal-based growth media which is particularly useful in assessing the safety of edible mushrooms before they are consumed.
