# Tinea Unguium
    
    Tinea unguium, also known as Onychomycosis, is a fungal infection of the nails caused by dermatophytes. It is highly contagious and can spread through direct contact, or by using a nail clipper or other tools on an infected nail. It can occur on both the hands and feet and is characterized by discoloration, thickening, and brittleness of the nails.
    
    ## Significance of Tinea Unguium to Mycology
    
    Tinea unguium is an important topic within mycology, as it is the most common fungal infection of the nails. It is important to understand the source of the infection and to provide an accurate diagnosis in order to properly treat the infection. Understanding the biology and ecology of the infection, as well as the various factors that influence its spread, is important to both contain the spread of the infection and to prevent it from recurring.

# Usage

Tinea unguium is a type of dermatophytosis caused by dermatophyte fungal species, of which the most common is Trichophyton rubrum. Tinea unguium is a significant cause of onychomycosis and, as such, is an important target of mycologic research. The ability to differentiate between different fungal species, such as T. rubrum, is of particular importance, since this allows for the prompt diagnosis and treatment of onychomycosis. The use of both traditional and molecular methods to identify the causative agent is an important part of mycology, as it allows for the development of more effective treatment strategies for tinea unguium. Additionally, research into the environmental and clinical factors associated with the risk of infection with tinea unguium can inform prevention and control strategies.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;Tinea unguium is a fungal infection of the nails that is caused by certain species of dermatophytic fungi, such as Trichophyton and Epidermophyton. It is the most common type of onychomycosis, accounting for up to 50% of all cases. The infection can be difficult to diagnose and treat due to the difficulty of culturing the causative organism. As such, Tinea unguium is widely studied and used to understand the biology and epidemiology of dermatophytic fungi. For example, research has shown that Trichophyton rubrum is the most common cause of Tinea unguium, with certain genotypes presenting more severe or frequent infections. This information can be used to inform preventative measures and treatment strategies, as well as develop new antifungal agents to combat Tinea unguium.&lt;/p&gt;
