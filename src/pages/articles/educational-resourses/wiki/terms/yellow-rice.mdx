# Definition
    
    Yellow rice (Oryza sativa) is a species of grass that is native to tropical and subtropical regions of the world. It is a popular crop and is used as a staple food in many parts of the world. 
    
    # Significance to Mycology
    
    Yellow rice is important to mycology because it can host a variety of fungi, bacteria, and other microbes. These organisms play important roles in the natural environment and in the production of food. For example, some fungi break down complex organic matter, leading to the release of important nutrients for plants. Other fungi may cause diseases in plants, leading to yield losses. The presence and abundance of these organisms is dependent on the variety of yellow rice and the environment in which it is grown. As such, mycologists study the composition and abundance of microbes associated with yellow rice to develop sustainable agricultural practices.

# Usage

Yellow rice is commonly used in mycology as a substrate for growing various fungi species. It is especially useful in research as it provides a predictable and nutrient-rich environment for the growth of various fungi. The yellow rice provides a uniform surface and environment for growing the fungi, allowing for repeated and reliable experiments and research results. Additionally, its small size and uniform shape allows for precise manipulations and experiments, including techniques such as micro-injection. The use of yellow rice as a substrate for growing various fungi species allows for the development of improved cultivation techniques, as well as furthering our understanding of how different fungi interact and develop in different environments.

# Example

Yellow rice is widely used in mycology to study the cultivation and consumption of fungi and mushrooms. For example, it is used in culture-based experiments to test the effects of certain growth mediums on various mushroom species. By comparing the growth of certain species in yellow rice media versus other media, scientists can measure the relative performance of the fungi and mushrooms in different conditions. Additionally, yellow rice can be used to create mushroom-based food products and dishes, leading to a wider consumption and appreciation of fungi and mushrooms.
