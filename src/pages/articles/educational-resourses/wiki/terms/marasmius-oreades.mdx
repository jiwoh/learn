## Definition 
    Marasmius oreades, commonly known as the fairy ring mushroom, is a species of saprotrophic basidiomycete fungus in the family Marasmiaceae.
    
    ## Significance to Mycology 
    Marasmius oreades is a popular edible mushroom that can be found growing wild, particularly in Europe and North America. It is also a model organism for studying fungal biology, specifically for understanding the complex interactions between fungi and their environment. Additionally, its ability to form large, visible clumps of fruiting bodies (known as "fairy rings") has made it a subject of many folklore tales.

# Usage

Marasmius oreades, commonly known as the fairy-ring mushroom, is an edible mushroom that has numerous applications in mycology. It has been used as a research model to study the effects of biotic and abiotic stress on saprotrophic fungi. Studies have shown that it can survive extreme temperatures, salts and pH, which makes it an ideal species to investigate the effects of environmental changes. Additionally, Marasmius oreades has been applied to understand the molecular mechanisms of fungal stress response, as well as a tool for gene expression analysis and bio-informatics. The high spore production of Marasmius oreades also allows for genetic studies involving single-spore isolation. Consequently, this species is used to explore the diversity of fungal populations, and is invaluable for taxonomic and evolutionary studies.

# Example

Marasmius oreades is a widely studied mushroom species for its use in both mushroom cultivation and consumption. It has been found to be an efficient species for studying the development of mycelial growth and fruit body formation in mushroom cultivation. Additionally, Marasmius oreades is often studied for its nutritional composition as well as its potential medicinal value. It is known to contain several compounds with potential therapeutic effects, such as polyphenols, which have been found to possess anti-inflammatory, anti-microbial, and anti-cancer properties. Furthermore, Marasmius oreades is widely consumed as a popular edible mushroom, due to its mild flavor and nutritional benefits.
