# Definition
    
    Appressorium is a specialized cell structure found on the surface of certain fungi which secretes adhesives and penetrates the substrate surface to form a base for processing and growth.
    
    # Significance
    
    Appressorium is essential for the successful establishment of fungal infection in a host, for example, the uptake of nutrients or the induction of resistance response. Its adhesive properties are key in allowing fungi to make contact with the substrate, penetrate the host, and spread disease. Appressorium is a critical component of the fungal life cycle and plays an important role in the pathogenesis of disease.

# Usage

Appressorium is an important tool used in mycology studies to investigate the interactions between fungal pathogens and their hosts. The appressorium is a specialized cell structure formed by certain pathogens to physically penetrate the outer layers of plant tissue and initiate infection. Appressorium-mediated disease can cause significant crop losses, so it is important to understand the mechanisms involved in appressorium formation. Analysis of the produce of Appressorium can help to elucidate the molecular basis of fungal pathogenesis and to develop strategies to mitigate disease. Additionally, Appressorium has implications for the development of more effective fungicides, as it can be used to identify and target key pathogenic processes.

# Example

Appressorium is a specialized organelle of certain fungi such as those belonging to the genera Magnaporthe and Ceratocystis, which helps in the penetration of host plants. Appressoria are specialized hyphal swellings that help to produce the pressure necassary to penetrate the cuticle of the host plants, which leads to the successful establishment of fungal infection. For example, the rice blast fungus Magnaporthe oryzae is known to have appressoria, which enables it to penetrate the plant's cuticle and cause devastating crop losses in rice production. As such, Appressorium is widely used in the study of fungi associated with crop losses, in order to investigate the structure and function of this organelle and its role in causing the infection. It is also used in the study of medicinal mushrooms, or in the cultivation or consumption of mushrooms for consumption.
