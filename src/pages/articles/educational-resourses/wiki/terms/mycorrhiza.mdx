## Definition:
    
    Mycorrhiza is a symbiotic relationship between a fungus and a plant root. This association allows the fungus to gain access to nutrients while providing essential growth resources to the plant. 
    
    ## Significance to Mycology: 
    
    Mycorrhizal associations are a necessary component of the sustainability and health of ecosystems. They are essential for the transfer of nutrients to plants, which in return provides food to animals and keeps the soil fertile. Mycorrhizal fungi also play important roles in providing protection to plants from pathogens, reducing nutrient losses, and allowing plants to access essential micro-nutrients. Therefore, Mycorrhizal research is integral to the understanding of many diverse fields in Mycology.

# Usage

Mycorrhizal fungi are beneficial symbiotic organisms that form mutualistic relationships with plants. They are integral components of healthy soil ecosystems, enabling plants to absorb essential nutrients from their environment. Mycorrhizal fungi increase the nutrient and water availability to their host plants by providing access to previously inaccessible sources of phosphorus, nitrogen, and other essential macronutrients. Additionally, they can provide protection against certain soil-borne pathogens and increase the plants' resilience to environmental stresses, such as drought. Mycorrhizal fungi are also important in agricultural production, as they can enhance crop yields and improve plant health. Research on Mycorrhiza has been invaluable in understanding the ecological implications of these fungi and the roles they play in terrestrial ecosystems.

# Example

Mycorrhiza is widely employed in the field of mycology, specifically for researching and understanding the growth, ecology, and cultivation of fungi, particularly mushrooms. For example, studies utilizing Mycorrhiza have shown that certain fungi display growth promotion when grown in certain soils, helping to improve crop yields of mushrooms. In addition, insight into the biochemistry of Mycorrhiza has been gained through research studies, aiding in the development of mushroom cultivation and consumption techniques.
