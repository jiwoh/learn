# Definition
    
    Dichotomous, in mycology, refers to the development of a mushroom or fungus in two distinct directions. It is a type of branching growth pattern, where the main stem divides into two parts, which in turn divide into two more parts, and so on.
    
    # Significance
    
    In mycology, dichotomous growth patterns are used to identify many different types of fungi. This is important in determining species and understanding their biology. Dichotomous growth patterns are also considered in mushroom cultivation, as they can affect the overall yield of a particular species. Finally, this pattern of growth can be used to differentiate a particular species from other fungi, aiding in study and identification of different species.

# Usage

&lt;p&gt;Dichotomous identification is a valuable tool for mycologists, as it allows for the rapid and reliable identification of fungal species. This involves the comparison of morphological characters, such as size, shape, spore production, and fruiting body structure, to known taxonomic descriptions. By systematically comparing these characteristics, mycologists can accurately identify specimens and determine if they belong to a known species or if they represent a novel species. With the help of dichotomous keys, which are hierarchically organized and structured, mycologists can quickly and effectively identify fungal species and provide valuable insight into their phylogenetic history. This information is essential for research, as it allows scientists to further explore and confirm their hypotheses, as well as to better understand the relationships among various fungal species.

# Example

Dichotomous keys are widely used by mycologists and other mushroom experts to identify various species of fungi. This technique allows for the determination of a mushroom's species through a series of questions with binary answers. Through this process, the user narrows down the list of potential species until the correct species is identified. For example, when identifying a mushroom, the user may be asked to determine whether the mushroom has a stem or not. If it does, the process may continue with questions about the color of the stem, the texture of the surface, and the size of the spores, until the specific species is identified.
