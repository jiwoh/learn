## Definition
    A Capsule is a fungal reproductive structure composed of two or more walls that bear and contain spores.
    
    ## Significance
    Capsules are the primary reproductive structures used by many species of fungi. They enable the dispersal of spores and are a key to the successful growth and prevalence of the species. The detailed structure and arrangement of the wall layers within a capsule can vary from species to species and is of great importance to the mycologist, since it can help to distinguish between species or even genera.

# Usage

Capsule is an essential tool for mycological research, as it enables researchers to observe, measure, and document the microscopic features of fungal spores, specifically the morphology and septation patterns. The precise and detailed measurements provided by Capsule can be used to accurately identify and classify various species of fungi. This information can then be used to trace the evolutionary and phylogenetic relationships between the various species, thus aiding in the advancement of scientific knowledge in the field. Additionally, the data obtained can be used to develop techniques to improve crop yields, identify and isolate fungal pathogens, and aid in the development of new drugs and treatments.

# Example

Capsule is a powerful tool for the study of fungi, mushrooms, and their cultivation or consumption. For instance, mycologists can use Capsule to create detailed taxonomic analyses of mushroom specimens. This analysis can be used to accurately identify and classify mushrooms and reveal the various characteristics of each species. Additionally, the Capsule platform can be used to track the growth and development of mushrooms in various growing environments and conditions. This is invaluable to mushroom cultivation professionals, as it allows them to optimize the growth rate and yield of their mushroom crops. Finally, Capsule's analysis capabilities can be used to identify and evaluate the nutritional and medicinal properties of mushrooms, which is invaluable information for mushroom-based health products and supplements.
