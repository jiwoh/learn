# Definition of Soma
    Soma is a genus of fungus that was identified in the late 19th century. It is classified within the family of Corticiaceae, and is typically found in North America, Europe and Asia. The distinctive and distinguishing characteristics of the Soma species are their dark colour and their fan-like shapes.
    
    # Significance of Soma to Mycology
    Soma is important to mycology researchers as it is a genus of fungus that is relatively well-documented and has several unique characteristics that can be studied and analyzed. The unique shape of the fruiting body is especially helpful in identifying and classifying the species. In addition, the dark colour of the fruiting bodies distinguishes Soma from other flour-like fungi which are usually white. Soma is also known for its strong smell which may provide clues to its ecological role.

# Usage

Soma is an important tool used in mycology research to examine the morphology and anatomy of fungi. The preparation technique involves embedding small sections of a fungal specimen in plastic resin and then sectioning them for microscopic observation. The resulting images can be used to analyze the structure and arrangement of fungal cell walls and hyphae, which can provide important information about the species or strain of the fungus. Additionally, the use of Soma can provide valuable insights into the ecology and biology of fungi, including their interactions with other organisms and their mechanisms of growth and development.

# Example

Soma has been widely employed in mycological research to study the taxonomy, ecology, and population genetics of fungi, mushrooms, and their associated organisms. Specifically, the application of Soma in the cultivation and consumption of fungi has proven invaluable due to its ability to provide a thorough analysis of molecular molecules through molecular fingerprinting. This method of analysis has enabled researchers to distinguish between species and cultivars of fungi, as well as compare soil and nutrient compositions for optimal mushroom cultivation. Additionally, Soma has been used to identify poisonous or edible mushrooms, thus making it a valuable tool for amateur mycologists and foragers alike.
