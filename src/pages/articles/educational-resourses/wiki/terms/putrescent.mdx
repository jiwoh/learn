# Putrescent
    Putrescent is a condition where the surface of a fruiting body (often a mushroom), or the entire organism, has begun to decay and rot. The putrid smell common to Putrescent mushrooms is due to the production of sulfur-containing compounds, primarily methyl mercaptan.
    
    ## Significance of Putrescent to Mycology
    The presence of Putrescent mushrooms is an important indicator of the health of an environment. Putrescent mushrooms often indicate the presence of overly wet, or overly dry, conditions, as well as an imbalance of carbon and nitrogen. They are also important for the decomposition of organic materials, and the release of nutrients back into the soil for use by other organisms.

# Usage

Putrescent is a mycological laboratory technique used to differentiate between fungal species based on their response to putrescine, a derivative of histidine which is derived from the conversion of amino acids by bacteria. Putrescent tests allow for the accurate identification of pathogenic fungi which may not be visible to the naked eye. Putrescent tests are also used to differentiate between closely related species, contributing to our understanding of fungal taxonomy and evolution. Putrescent tests are especially useful in clinical settings, enabling accurate diagnosis and treatment of fungal infections.

# Example

Putrescent is widely used in the study of fungi by providing a method to detect the presence of conidia, which are the asexual reproductive spores of many species of fungi. In the laboratory, it involves culturing a sample of the species in question onto a plate containing a solution of potassium hydroxide and dilute hydrochloric acid. This will turn the spore-bearing structures black and reveal the presence of conidia. This method can also be used to determine the specific species of fungal growth based on the shape and size of the conidia. Furthermore, Putrescent is frequently employed in the cultivation and consumption of mushrooms, as the technique can be used to detect the presence of harmful mycotoxins.
