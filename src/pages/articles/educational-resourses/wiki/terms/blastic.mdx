## Definition
    
    Blastic is a type of mold that is typically found growing on organic materials in soil and is classified as belonging to the order Mucorales. The species most commonly found in this group is Mucor racemosus, which is an important indicator species of environmental mycology.
    
    ## Significance
    
    Blastic is important in mycology because it is an indicator species for soil fertility and its presence reflects the health of the environment in which it grows. It is a valuable tool for the study of decomposition dynamics and nutrient cycling in soil ecosystems. It has also been used in bioindication and bioremediation to assess the degree of pollution in an area. By studying and monitoring the growth of this species, it is possible to gain an understanding of the impacts of anthropogenic activities on the environment.

# Usage

Blastic is a field microscopy technique used for studying mycological specimens. By using a Blastic mount, it is possible to observe the external morphology of fungal hyphae and conidia clearly. This technique is used to classify species and investigate different aspects of mycology, such as fungal taxonomy, conidial structure, and hyphal growth. Additionally, Blastic mount can be used to study the staining of fungal hyphae with various dyes to determine species characteristics. Blastic is a useful and practical method for researchers to obtain detailed mycological information and to further understand the biology of fungi.

# Example

Blastic has been an increasingly popular tool for mycologists to study the genetics of fungi, mushrooms, and their associated biological processes. Specifically, Blastic has been used in studies employing genetic diversity analysis to examine the production of mushroom metabolites, such as polysaccharides or proteins, which are widely employed in the cultivation and consumption of certain mushroom species. Moreover, for species widely employed in edible mycology such as Lentinula edodes, the Blastic genome browser has enabled researchers to analyze and visualize the genetic expression of mushroom-specific enzymes, providing invaluable insight into the optimal cultivation and selection of edible mushroom species.
