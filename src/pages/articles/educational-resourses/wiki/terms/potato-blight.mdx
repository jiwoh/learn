# Potato Blight
    
    Potato blight is a serious fungal disease caused by the pathogen *Phytophthora infestans*. It is one of the most destructive diseases of potato plants and can cause systemic rot, leaf blight, and crop destruction. Potato blight is important to mycology because it is a global problem that has caused famine and economic hardships in many parts of the world. It is a perfect example of the devastating impact that a fungal pathogen can have on the human population and can be used to understand the biology and ecology of other pathogenic fungi.

# Usage

Potato blight, caused by the fungus Phytophthora infestans, is a major problem for potato farmers worldwide. The disease is difficult to control and can lead to significant crop losses if left unchecked. The use of fungicides to control the blight has become increasingly difficult due to the emergence of fungicide-resistant strains of the fungus. In response, researchers have turned to the study of genetic resistance in potatoes as a potential solution. Through this research, researchers have identified genetic markers that can be used to select potato varieties with high levels of resistance to the blight. Furthermore, this knowledge has enabled the development of efficient and accurate molecular diagnostic tests that can be used to detect the presence of the disease in the field. Thus, Potato blight has become an important research focus and has become a valuable tool for practical applications in mycology.

# Example

Potato blight, also known as Phytophthora infestans, is a highly destructive pathogen that infects potato and tomato crops. It is widely studied because it has become a major horticultural pest in many agricultural systems around the world. Potato blight is particularly important to the cultivation and consumption of potatoes and tomatoes, as it has been responsible for some of the most well-known historical famines. The pathogen is capable of causing blighted potatoes that develop dark spots on their skin, as well as wilting and death of the foliage. By studying Potato blight, researchers can understand how the pathogen causes potato tufts to become infected and how to control it with fungicides and other crop management techniques. Additionally, understanding Potato blight can help to develop more effective methods of preventing and controlling this devastating plant disease.
