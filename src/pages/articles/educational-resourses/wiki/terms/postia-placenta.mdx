# Postia placenta
    
    Postia placenta is a species of [[polypore]] mushroom that is found mainly in temperate and boreal forests of the Northern Hemisphere. The fruiting body of Postia placenta is quite large, measuring up to 25 cm in diameter, and has a velvety, yellow-brown to dark brown cap surface.
    
    ## Significance to Mycology
    
    Postia placenta is an important species of fungi for mycologists because of its ability to breakdown woody biomass and other wood-based materials. Furthermore, the species provides an ideal system for studying patterns of wood decomposition and nutrient cycling. As a result, Postia placenta is a model organism in the study of fungal ecology and the ways in which decomposer organisms interact with their environment.

# Usage

Postia placenta, commonly known as the ‘Leather Bracket’ or ‘Coal fungus’, is an important part of mycology research, as it is an important tool for both mycologists and palaeo-ecologists. Postia placenta is used to deduce past climates and environmental conditions and track changes in both terrestrial and aquatic ecosystems, making it an invaluable source of information for scientists studying the environment. In addition, Postia placenta is a valuable research tool for mycologists investigating the evolution and phylogeny of Fungi, as it can be used to distinguish different species and related taxa, and to identify the potential of species migration and dispersal. Its ability to survive in harsh environmental conditions, and its wide-ranging distribution across multiple biomes, also makes Postia placenta a viable choice for environmental monitoring, as it is highly resistant to fluctuating environmental conditions.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;Postia placenta is widely utilized in the study of mycology due to its ability to form efficient symbiotic relationships with various fungi, mushrooms, and other organisms. Specifically, it is commonly used as a natural agent in mushroom cultivation as it is capable of forming a mycorrhiza, a mutual symbiotic relationship between a fungus and its host, where the fungus provides essential minerals and nutrients to the host and the host provides nourishment in the form of carbohydrates and other essential growth-stimulating factors. Postia placenta is also employed in the consumption of fungi, as it can help detoxify certain fungi into a palatable and nutritious form. Furthermore, its diverse biochemical properties make it useful in studying the various species of fungi and mushrooms.
