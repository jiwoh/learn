## Rhizopus stolonifer
    
    Rhizopus stolonifer, commonly known as black bread mold, is a species of the zygomycete fungal genus Rhizopus. It is a saprotrophic fungus, meaning it derives its nutrient sources from decaying organic matter. It has a worldwide distribution and is commonly found in soil and on decaying plants, fruits, and vegetables.
    
    ## Significance to Mycology
    
    Rhizopus stolonifer is an important organism in the field of mycology. It is widely studied due to its saprotrophic lifestyle and ability to survive in a variety of environments. Additionally, its presence in the environment plays an important role in the decomposition of organic material, which helps to maintain the global carbon cycle. Moreover, it is a significant source of food for other fungi and bacteria, and produces various metabolites of pharmaceutical and industrial interest. As such, Rhizopus stolonifer has proven to be an invaluable organism for the study of mycology.

# Usage

Rhizopus stolonifer is a species of zygomycete fungus that is widely distributed in nature and is a common cause of food spoilage. In mycology, Rhizopus stolonifer has been found to be useful in several research and practical applications, such as the production of secondary metabolites, the production of pharmaceuticals, and the improvement of plant growth. Furthermore, Rhizopus stolonifer has been used in medical mycology research to identify potential anti-fungal drugs and study the mechanisms of fungal infection. As a result, this species plays an important role in understanding important aspects of fungal biology and is a useful tool in mycological research.

# Example

Rhizopus stolonifer is a common species of fungus which is widely used in mushroom cultivation, both commercially and in academic research. The fungus can be readily produced in liquid culture and grown in laboratory settings, making it an ideal model for studying the growth and development of mushroom mycelia. The fungus is also used to investigate the potential nutritional benefits associated with mushroom consumption and the effects of different cultivation techniques on the quality of the final product. Additionally, Rhizopus stolonifer is a useful tool for investigating the interactions between fungi and other organisms, such as bacteria, to better understand the ecology of mushroom environments.
