# Definition
    
    Lichenometry is the scientific method of measuring the size and age of lichens, which are symbiotic organisms that contain a mutualistic relationship between a fungus and an alga.
    
    # Significance
    
    Lichenometry is an important tool for mycologists, as it enables them to accurately estimate the age of a lichen specimen and to make deductions about the environmental conditions in which it is found. By measuring the size of a lichen, the size of which is determined by the rate of growth and the environmental conditions, it is possible to assess the age of the specimen, since lichens grow slowly over time. This is especially useful in geological studies, as lichens are often used as indicators of past environmental conditions and for verifying the estimated age of various geological phenomena.

# Usage

Lichenometry is a useful tool for measuring the absolute age of surfaces in areas where lichens are found. This method has been successfully applied to dating glaciated surfaces, determining post-glacial retreat rates, and estimating when vegetation was established after the last deglaciation. By calculating the diameter of a lichen colony or thallus, a scientist can calculate its age depending on the growth rate of the particular species of lichen. This can provide insight into past climates, as well as provide data on the rate of geological process. Lichenometry has gained relevance in fields such as geomorphology, geology, climatology, and ecology.

# Example

Lichenometry is commonly used in the study of fungi and mushrooms to estimate their age and growth rate. By measuring and comparing the abundance of lichen species on the same living organism, researchers can estimate the age of the organism by reference to a lichenometric curve. This technique is particularly useful for estimating the age of mushrooms or other fungi that are difficult to date directly. In addition, lichenometry can be used to assess environmental conditions (e.g., air pollution, temperature) over time and to monitor the health and growth rate of mushroom populations.
