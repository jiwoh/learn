# Definition of Substratum
    
    Substratum is the underlying material that fungi are grown on. It is the material on which mycelium (a network of fungal filaments) is formed. In the context of mycology, it is used to refer to the medium on which fungi are grown in laboratory or commercial settings.
    
    # Significance of Substratum to Mycology
    
    Substratum is an important component for growing fungi in a controlled environment, as it provides a stable base for the mycelium to attach to and develop. Substratum also provides nutrients and other necessary materials for fungal growth. The substrate chosen for a particular experiment will have a major impact on the success of the cultivation process. Choosing the wrong substrate can lead to lower yields, higher mortality, and slower growth. Different types of substrata are used depending on the type of fungi being grown, the desired product, and the cultivation environment.

# Usage

Substratum is widely used in mycology research to study the growth and development of fungi. This technique allows researchers to observe the physiology, behavior, and interactions of different species of fungi on various substrata. By growing fungi on different substrata, researchers can analyze their growth rate, metabolic processes, and environmental adaptation. Substratum is also used to examine the ability of fungi to produce secondary metabolites, which can provide important data on the potential use of fungi as novel bioactive compounds. In addition, Substratum can be used to prepare and identify fungal isolates for further studies. Collectively, these applications allow us to better understand the life cycle and unique characteristics of fungi, as well as their potential applications in biomedical and agricultural research.

# Example

Substratum is an important tool in the field of mycology, used to study the growth and development of fungi, mushrooms, and other related organisms. Substratum is a type of organic material on which fungi can grow, which can include materials like wood chips, wood shavings, sawdust, shredded newspaper, coffee grounds, and other organic materials. Substratum is widely used in the cultivation of mushrooms, as it serves as a medium for the mycelium to develop and produce fruiting bodies. Substratum also plays a role in the consumption of mushrooms, as certain substrata can impart distinct flavors and textures to mushrooms, as well as influencing their levels of nutrition, quality, and health benefits.
