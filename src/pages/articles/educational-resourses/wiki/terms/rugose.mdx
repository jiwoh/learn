## Definition
    
    Rugose is an adjective referring to the presence of a type of spore-bearing surface in some types of mushrooms. The surface is composed of small, smooth, and raised areas that resemble a ridged surface, or a surface with corrugations.
    
    ## Significance
    
    The presence of a rugose spore-bearing surface is an important morphological characteristic of certain species of mushrooms. Due to the texture of the surface, microscopic examination of the spore-bearing surface is necessary to differentiate between species. The presence of a rugose spore-bearing surface is also an indication of the presence of plentiful, smooth, and raised areas that are suitable for spore production. Additionally, the presence of a rugose spore-bearing surface is often associated with the production of large, viable spores.

# Usage

Rugose is a term used in mycology to describe the surface ornamentation of various fungi. Rugose fungi possess mosaic-like surface sculptures comprised of small, conical wrinkles with a distinctive radial pattern. This type of surface ornamentation is commonly found in the species belonging to the Ascomycota phylum, many of which produce important compounds used in the medical and food industries. For instance, the genus Penicillium produces the medically important antibiotic penicillin and the genus Trichoderma produces compounds with anti-inflammatory properties. Additionally, Rugose fungi are used for the production of enzymes for use in food-processing industries. Therefore, Rugose fungi have practical applications in medicine and food production, and the study of their surface ornamentation plays an important role in research.

# Example

Rugose has become a widely accepted tool in mycology due to its ability to conduct accurate genetic sequencing of fungi, mushrooms, and related species. This allows mycologists to more easily identify and differentiate among species, as well as to gain insight into the evolutionary history of mushrooms. Furthermore, Rugose can be used to study the genetics of mushroom cultivation and consumption, enabling researchers to better understand the conditions and processes that contribute to the growth and development of these fungi.
