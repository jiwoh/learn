# Definition
    A fungicide is a pesticide used to prevent, halt, or control the growth and spread of fungi and fungal spores, particularly plant-pathogenic fungi and oomycete species.
    
    ## Significance to Mycology 
    Fungicides have a pivotal role in mycology. They can be used to protect crops and other plants from fungal infection and disease. Fungicides may also be used to control certain types of plant parasites, such as fusarium and phoma. Fungicides are used to minimize the risk of fungal-induced issues, keeping both agricultural and horticultural crops healthy and safe. Fungicides can also be beneficial to the environment, by curtailing the spread of dangerous or invasive species that can damage ecosystems and reduce biodiversity. As a result, fungicides are an important tool in mycology, helping to protect our environment and enable sustainable crop production.

# Usage

Fungicide is a key tool in mycology for the prevention, control, and elimination of fungal diseases. Fungicide treatments are often employed in the protection of crops from the detrimental effects of fungi and their associated diseases. Additionally, Fungicide is used in laboratory research for the elimination of fungi on agar plates, slides, or cultures, providing a clean environment for working with other microbes and assessing fungal pathogenicity. Fungicides are also employed to protect research materials during transportation and storage, safeguarding against contamination and decay. The use of Fungicide in these various capacities ensures the successful execution of research and practical applications across mycology by allowing for the control of fungal growth and activity.

# Example

Fungicides are widely used to protect agricultural crops from fungal diseases. For example, strobilurin fungicides are commonly used to reduce crop losses due to diseases caused by species of fungi in the genera Botrytis, Fusarium, and Sclerotinia. They are also used to prevent or reduce the spread of mushrooms during the fruiting stage in mushroom cultivation. Fungicides are also used to eliminate fungal contamination of grains and other food sources, preventing spoilage or food-borne illness caused by fungal toxins. Finally, fungicides are sometimes used to enhance the safety of consuming wild mushrooms by reducing the amount of fungi on the mushroom prior to ingestion.
