## Definition
    
    Annulus (pl. Annuli) is a ring-shaped or cup-shaped feature at the top of a mushroom stem, often found on mushrooms belonging to the order Agaricales. This feature is used to differentiate between species of fungi and can vary in size, shape, texture, color and position.
    
    ## Significance
    
    The Annulus is a key morphological characteristic of many fungi, allowing mycologists to easily differentiate between species. It also serves as a useful tool in taxonomic identification, and can help differentiate between members of the same family or genus. Additionally, the Annulus is often used to distinguish between edibles and non-edibles, as well as between poisonous and non-poisonous mushrooms. As such, the Annulus is an important feature for mycologists to identify and understand.

# Usage

Annulus is a type of spore-producing structure found in certain types of fungi. It is an important tool in mycology as it is used to classify, identify, and study fungal species. Annulus is used to differentiate between species based on the size, shape, and arrangement of the spores, as well as their color, texture, and other morphological characteristics. It is also used to distinguish between closely related species and varieties of the same species. Further, Annulus is a valuable tool for examining the phylogeny of the fungal organisms, which helps to understand the evolution and spread of the species. In addition, this structure is also used in the development of new fungal species and the identification of potential pathogens.

# Example

Annulus is a widely used tool for studying fungi, mushrooms, and their cultivation and consumption. It is commonly used in mycology to examine the external morphology of mushrooms, as the distinctive characteristics of the annulus are often used to distinguish species. Additionally, Annulus can be used to study the impact of environmental variables on mushroom growth. For instance, Annulus can be used to observe changes in the growth rate and texture of mushrooms in response to simulated environmental conditions, such as temperature, light, and humidity. Finally, Annulus can also be used to assess the nutritional value and safety of mushrooms, as the annulus can provide information about the presence of toxins or allergens.
