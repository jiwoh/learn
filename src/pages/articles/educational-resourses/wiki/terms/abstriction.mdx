# Definition of Abstriction
    
    Abstriction is a process in mycology where a fungal spore becomes airborne and is then translocated to another location and colonizes successfully. 
    
    # Significance
    
    Abstriction is an important process in mycology as it provides a means for fungi to disperse to new areas, and thus to colonize different environments. Fungi are important decomposers of organic material and beneficial symbionts of many plants, and the ability to disperse and colonize new sites is essential for the survival of fungal populations. Besides for dispersal, abstriction may also aid in the formation of new species and the adaptation of established species.

# Usage

Abstraction allows mycologists to quickly and effectively identify fungi based on their morphology and other physical characteristics without the need for detailed microscopy or laboratory testing. This is useful in the field, when quick identification of a species is necessary. Additionally, abstractions can be used in research to quickly compare multiple species of fungi and identify similarities and differences between them. This allows researchers to better understand how species evolve and how different evolutionary paths are represented in different species. Finally, abstraction can also be used to create databases of mycological information, making it easier to access and study.

# Example

Abstriction is a core concept in mycology, the study of fungi, mushrooms, and their consumption and cultivation. In mycology, Abstriction is used to simplify complex concepts related to fungi, mushrooms, and associated processes. It is also used to study various mushroom species at various hierarchical levels such as subkingdom, phylum, order, family, genus, and species. Abstriction can be used to compare the different species of mushrooms and identify their similarities and differences. For example, it can be used to compare different species of mushrooms for the size of their spores or the texture of their stalks. Additionally, Abstriction is applied in the study of mushroom ecology and habitat, by using data collected from various habitats to compare and understand different mushroom species. Finally, Abstriction is used to identify mushroom taxa and categorize different fungi into different genera and species.
