# Definition of Lateral
    
    Lateral is a term used to describe the fruiting bodies of mushrooms and other fungi that are not attached to the main stalk or stem. Lateral fruiting bodies can either emerge directly from the substrate or be connected to the substrate via a short, thin stem. Lateral fruiting bodies are usually found in the form of gills, pores, or spines.
    
    # Significance of Lateral in Mycology
    
    The presence of lateral fruiting bodies is an important identifier when it comes to identifying and categorizing mushrooms and other fungi. Lateral fruiting bodies are also useful in distinguishing different species and subspecies of mushrooms, as certain types of lateral fruiting bodies are exclusive to certain species. For example, the presence of gills can help distinguish members of the Agaricus genus from other genera. Knowing the presence and type of lateral fruiting bodies can also help in determining edibility, as certain fungi have a distinct and recognizable way of fruiting, making them easily identifiable and distinguishable from their look-alikes.

# Usage

Lateral is widely used in mycology to analyze the phylogenetic relationships of fungal species. Through the application of Lateral gene sequencing, mycologists are able to construct high-resolution phylogenies of their subject species. This technique relies on the comparison of orthologous gene sequences between different species and can be used to determine the evolutionary relationships between them based on the patterns of gene conservation. Lateral gene sequencing is a powerful tool that provides researchers with valuable insights into the evolutionary history of their species, allowing them to better understand how some traits have been conserved and how they might have changed over time.

# Example

Lateral is widely used to study the interaction between fungi, mushrooms, and humans. For instance, researchers have used quantitative Lateral variation analysis to study the genetic variability between commercial and wild-harvested Pleurotus eryngii mushrooms in Europe. The study found that the commercial mushroom had much higher genetic variability than its wild-harvested counterpart, indicating that the former had been widely cultivated and modified by humans. This study highlights the potential of Lateral to identify patterns of human-mediated selection and to better understand the interplay between fungi, mushrooms and humans.
