# Free
    
    Free can refer to myceliated, filamentous fungal cells that are not attached to the surface or to each other. This distinction is important in some types of laboratory culture media, where freedom of movement is necessary. Free cells are often referred to as hyphal cells and may be used in research to better understand the growth and development of fungal organisms.
    
    Free is also used when discussing fungal diseases of plants, animals, and humans. Free cells can cause infection by attaching themselves to the host's cells and using the host's nutrients for growth. These cells can then release toxins into the host's cells, damaging tissue and leading to disease.

# Usage

&lt;p&gt;In mycology, Free is used to refer to a specific physiological trait in fungi. This trait is characterized by the unrestricted growth of fungal hyphae, which is converse to the restricted growth seen in fungi with the Attached trait. The Free trait is important in mycology research, as it can be used to distinguish between species of fungi and to identify unique evolutionary pathways. Furthermore, the Free trait is often correlated with the ability of fungi to rapidly colonize new environments, allowing for the study of interactions between fungi and their environment.

# Example

Free is widely used to study fungi, mushrooms, and their cultivation and consumption. For example, the software package Free can be used to compare the genetic and physiological characteristics of different species of fungi. This software has been used to identify key genetic markers and physiological traits associated with the growth, development, and nutrition of fungi, and to identify mushrooms with desirable characteristics for human consumption. Similarly, it can be used to analyze the environmental conditions that are necessary for the cultivation of specific species of mushrooms, such as temperature, nutrient levels, light, and water availability. This analysis can provide information to help optimize cultivation conditions and outcomes.
