# Definition
    
    Homokaryotic is a term used in mycology to describe a type of fungal cell that has only one nucleus per cell, as opposed to a dikaryon which has two.  
    
    # Significance
    
    Homokaryotic cells are common in the division of Basidiomycota, where they are often found in agaric and club fungi. They are also found in some ascomycetes and zygomycetes. The ability of homokaryotic cells to merge and form dikaryotic cells allows fungi to hybridize and reproduce without needing a partner. As a result, these cells are an important component of the fungal life cycle.

# Usage

Homokaryotic is a term used to refer to a type of fungi that has a single nuclei within each cell. In mycology, homokaryotic fungi are distinguished from heterokaryotic fungi, which have multiple nuclei per cell. Homokaryotic fungi could potentially be used in agricultural applications as they are often more genetically tractable and amenable to manipulation. Additionally, researchers have utilized homokaryotic fungi in a wide range of experiments for studying the roles that individual gene products play in fungal development, morphogenesis, and pathogenicity. The use of homokaryotic fungi thus has significant scientific importance for enhancing our understanding of the genetics and biology of fungi.

# Example

Homokaryotic is widely used in the field of mycology, the study of fungi, for both research and cultivation. For example, researchers have used homokaryotic cultures of the edible mushroom Agaricus bisporus to better understand the mechanisms underlying mushroom growth. This research has enabled the development of new cultivation techniques and improved the production of high quality products for human consumption. Additionally, homokaryotic cultures have also been used to investigate the genetic diversity of fungal species, identify new strains, and develop novel strategies for preserving fungal species with potential value in food production, medicine, and bioremediation.
