# Definition
    
    Tinea versicolor is a common skin infection caused by the fungus Malassezia. It is also known as pityriasis versicolor. The infection causes discolored patches of skin on the trunk and upper arms that may be lighter or darker than the normal skin color.
    
    # Significance to Mycology
    
    Tinea versicolor is a form of mycosis, meaning it is caused by a fungus. This condition is more common in warm weather and regions with high humidity. Therefore, understanding the causes and effects of tinea versicolor can help provide insight into the ecology of certain fungal species, aiding in mycological research. Treatment for tinea versicolor may include antifungal creams, topical ointments, or oral medications.

# Usage

Tinea versicolor is a common fungal infection of the skin caused by the yeast-like fungus Malassezia globosa. This infection typically affects young adults and presents as white or tan patches on the skin. Tinea versicolor is most commonly diagnosed by a skin scraping and examination of the sample under a microscope. Treatment typically consists of antifungal medications.
    
    In mycology, Tinea versicolor is most commonly studied due to its medical relevance. Research into the epidemiology of this fungus has shown potential risk factors, such as high humidity and warm temperatures, which can increase the rate of infection. Additionally, research investigating the effects of topical and systemic antifungal treatments has increased our understanding of this disease. Tinea versicolor is also used as a model for the study of antifungal drug resistance, which can inform future treatments of this infection.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;Tinea versicolor is a fungal infection caused by the yeast &lt;i&gt;Malassezia furfur&lt;/i&gt;. This species is a common component of the normal skin microflora, but can cause infection when it overgrows in certain environmental conditions. It is commonly used in the study of fungal diversity, as well as in the production of food and medicinal products from mushrooms, due to its ability to colonize and degrade various organic substrates. In addition, &lt;i&gt;M. furfur&lt;/i&gt; can be used to control certain mushroom pests and to stimulate the growth of commercially important edible and medicinal mushrooms, such as &lt;i&gt;Ganoderma lucidum&lt;/i&gt; and &lt;i&gt;Trametes versicolor&lt;/i&gt;. Furthermore, &lt;i&gt;M. furfur&lt;/i&gt;-containing preparations have been used to treat various skin diseases and to improve the growth of certain plant species in agricultural environments.
