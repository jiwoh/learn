# Definition of Prebiotics in Fungal Food Products
    
    Prebiotics are non-digestible food ingredients that selectively stimulate the growth and/or activity of beneficial microorganisms in the gut. In fungal food products, prebiotics are typically found in the form of certain polysaccharides, carbohydrates, and oligosaccharides that can promote the growth of beneficial fungi and yeast, such as Saccharomyces cerevisiae, Aspergillus oryzae, and Lactobacillus species.
    
    ## Significance of Prebiotics in Fungal Food Products
    
    Prebiotics in fungal food products can provide health benefits to humans. By promoting the growth and activity of essential bacteria, these prebiotics can help improve digestive health, reduce the risk of chronic diseases, boost the immune system, and even reduce cholesterol levels. Furthermore, prebiotics can also increase the bioavailability of vitamins, minerals, and other essential nutrients in fungal food products, making them more nutritionally beneficial to humans.

# Usage

Prebiotics in fungal food products are used in mycology to promote the growth of beneficial fungi such as probiotics. They can be added as an ingredient to a fungal diet, or to promote the production of bioactive compounds such as indole-3-acetic acid (IAA) from the probiotic fungi. Prebiotics are also used to influence gene expression in fungi, which can be beneficial for understanding their life cycles and developing new applications. Furthermore, prebiotics are used in the production of mycoprotein and other fungal-based food products, which have the potential to provide a sustainable alternative to traditional proteins for food production. Finally, prebiotics can also be used to improve the nutritional value of fungal food products, as certain types of prebiotics have been shown to improve mineral absorption, while others can help reduce inflammation and increase immunity.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;Prebiotics are typically used in the cultivation of fungi, mushrooms, and other related products in order to increase the production of beneficial microorganisms. For example, prebiotics often contain inulin, which is a type of soluble dietary fiber that can be used to promote the growth of naturally occurring probiotic bacteria. Therefore, prebiotics in fungal food products have an indirect effect on the growth and health of the fungi, mushrooms, and other related products. Additionally, prebiotics can be added to various fungal food products, such as fermented foods, to boost the colon health of the consumer. In this way, prebiotics in fungal food products can positively contribute to the desired nutritional benefits of the food.  &lt;/p&gt;
