# Definition of Probiotics in Fungal Food Products 
    
    Probiotics in Fungal food products are preparations of beneficial microorganisms added to food products in order to provide beneficial intestinal microbiota. These beneficial microorganisms stimulate the immune system and provide a competitive environment to inhibit the growth of detrimental microbial species. 
    
    ## Significance of Probiotics in Fungal Food Products in Mycology
    
    The use of probiotics in fungal food products has been of particular significance in mycology, as it has allowed for a greater control of the quality of the product, i.e. the prevention of fungal contamination and the improvement of food shelf-life. In addition, the inclusion of probiotics in fungal food products has been beneficial in increasing the nutritional value of the diet and improving gut health. Furthermore, probiotics in fungal food products have the potential to mitigate the occurrence of mycotoxicoses, food poisoning, and food allergies. Additionally, due to their ability to produce vitamins and enzymes, probiotics increase the nutritive value of fermented foods and other food products, making them more nutrient-dense.

# Usage

&lt;p&gt;Probiotics in fungal food products are increasingly used in mycology to enhance the nutritional quality of fungal food products. Research has demonstrated that the addition of probiotics to fungal food products can modulate metabolism, improve health, and reduce spoilage, thus increasing the shelf-life of the products. In addition, probiotics in fungal food products can improve the texture and flavor of the food, enhancing the consumer's experience. Thus, probiotics in fungal food products can be used to improve the quality, safety, and nutritional value of fungal food products, making them a valuable tool in the mycologist's toolbox.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;One example of how probiotics in fungal food products are widely used to study fungi, mushrooms, or in their cultivation or consumption is the development of "mycoprotein" products. Mycoprotein is a type of edible protein produced from the fermentation of fungi, such as the filamentous fungus Fusarium venenatum. The fermentation process involves the addition of probiotics to the fungal culture, which helps to break down the carbohydrates and lipids within the fungi and produce a high quality protein product. Mycoprotein products are becoming increasingly popular as a plant-based alternative to traditional animal proteins, and as such, research regarding their production and characteristics is ongoing.
