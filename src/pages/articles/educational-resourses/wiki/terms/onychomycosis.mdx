## Definition
    
    Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nails (fingers and/or toes), specifically caused by dermatophytes, yeasts, and molds. It is among the most common fungal infections, and it can sometimes be difficult to treat.
    
    ## Significance to Mycology
    
    Onychomycosis is an important area of mycology as it can have a serious effect on the health of individuals who are infected. Dermatophytes, yeasts, and molds are all different kinds of fungi, so mycologists must be familiar with the various species of fungi that cause it in order to accurately diagnose and treat the infection. Additionally, a thorough understanding of the biology of the organism causing the infection and the environment in which it proliferates, is necessary to develop effective treatments.

# Usage

Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail plate, most commonly seen in the toenails due to the warm and moist environment found inside shoes. In mycology, the use of Onychomycosis for research and practical applications is essential for the identification and treatment of numerous fungal species. Studies have shown that Onychomycosis is the most common form of fungal infections in humans, and it is important to understand how it behaves in order to develop effective treatments and preventative measures. The fungal composition of Onychomycosis samples can be used to identify the pathogenesis of the infection, as well as the effectiveness of various antifungal medications. Additionally, Onychomycosis can be used to study the evolutionary interactions between fungi and their hosts, especially in terms of the development of drug resistance in certain fungal species. Thus, Onychomycosis is an essential tool for mycologists in both research and practical applications.

# Example

&lt;p&gt;Onychomycosis is a fungal infection of the nail plate and surrounding nail bed that is caused by a variety of fungi, including dermatophytes, nondermatophytes, and yeast. It is commonly used to study the effect of certain fungi on the growth and development of mushrooms, as well as their use in mushroom cultivation and consumption. For example, a study in 2020 demonstrated the antifungal efficacy of a polyene-containing nanocomposite film against a strain of Trichophyton rubrum, a common cause of onychomycosis. This research provides evidence that polyene nanocomposite films can be used to inhibit the growth of potentially pathogenic fungi, thus providing a potential solution to prevent or treat onychomycosis and other fungal infections of the nail plate and bed. Furthermore, this research has implications for mushroom cultivation and consumption, as these nanocomposite films can potentially help reduce contamination of edible mushrooms by a variety of fungal species.&lt;/p&gt;
