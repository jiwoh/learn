# Definition 
    
    Substrate is a material or substance, usually organic, on which fungi grow and derive their nutrition.
    
    # Significance
    
    Substrate is a defining factor in mycology as it provides a medium for fungi to grow. Understanding the various substrates that can provide a suitable environment for fungi growth can be key to understanding the interaction between fungi and their environment. Substrate can also affect the development of certain mycorrhizal relationships and aid in the propagation of fungi in a given environment.

# Usage

Substrate is widely used in mycology for the study of fungal interactions and their environmental relevance. Substrate offers a powerful analytical tool for researchers to explore the impacts of a variety of environmental influences on the growth and development of fungi. By providing a controlled and consistent growth medium, Substrate allows researchers to investigate the mechanisms behind changes in the growth rate, production of extracellular enzymes, and gene expression of various fungal species. This insight into the effects of external factors on the fungal community structure is invaluable in understanding their roles in ecological systems. In addition, Substrate is used as a diagnostic tool for detecting, diagnosing, and controlling fungal diseases. The ability to directly compare the growth rate, production of enzymes, and gene expression of different fungal species under the same conditions makes Substrate an essential tool for studying and managing fungal diseases.

# Example

Substrate is a widely used tool for studying fungal biology, including the cultivation and consumption of mushrooms. For example, Substrate is often employed to study mycorrhizal fungi, which form symbiotic relationships with plants to increase their nutrient uptake and provide protection from pathogens. Substrate can also be used to monitor the growth of mushrooms, as well as to measure their metabolites and toxins. Additionally, it can help farmers assess the suitability of soils for cultivating mushrooms, and home gardeners to accurately identify harvested species for consumption.
