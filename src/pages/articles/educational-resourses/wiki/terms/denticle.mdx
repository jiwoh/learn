## Definition
    
    Denticle is a small, hard, disc-like structure and the primary feature of certain fungi in the Basidiomycota phylum. Denticles are formed by the fusion of the terminal cells of hyphae and can vary in size and shape, depending on the species of fungus. 
    
    ## Significance
    
    Denticles are important features of fungal taxonomy, with some species containing up to 20 varieties. Moreover, denticles are used to identify specific species within the Basidiomycota phylum, helping to differentiate between related fungi and assisting in classification. Denticles have also been used in the study of fungal evolution, as some researchers have observed changes in denticles in response to environmental pressures.

# Usage

Denticle usage in mycology includes the identification of fungal species. Denticles are the hard, shell-like structures that are present in the outer wall of some fungal species and can be used in identifying them. Denticles are also used to differentiate species within the same family and can be used to distinguish between different varieties of fungi, such as Ascomycetes and Basidiomycetes. Moreover, Denticle analysis can provide valuable information regarding the evolution and phylogenetic relationships of different species of fungi. The use of Denticles has been a powerful tool in the study of mycology and has provided valuable clues in understanding the evolution and diversity of fungal species, as well as aiding in their identification.

# Example

Denticle is a microscopy technique widely used in mycology to study fungi and mushrooms. In particular, Denticle can be used to observe the presence, shape, and size of denticles (micrometric projections) on the surface of mushroom basidia, which are modified hyphal cells that produce basidiospores. By studying the denticles, mycologists can identify microscopic differences between species and strains of mushrooms, aiding in the documentation and classification of mushrooms. Additionally, Denticle has also been used to study the effect of specific cultivation and consumption practices on the appearance and size of mushroom denticles.
